    "content": "this legal case involves a dispute between two spouses over the ownership of a boat the court of first instance ruled that the boat is coowned property and should be divided between the spouses the defendant appealed this decision arguing that the court made errors in applying the law and assessing the facts they claimed that the boat should be considered separate property and that the burden of proof should have been shifted to the plaintiff however the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the lower court stating that the defendant did not provide enough evidence to support their claim the court also found that the defendants appeal was an attempt to avoid paying a tax debt and did not alter the legal nature of the property therefore the appeal was dismissed and the defendant is responsible for paying the costs",
