Ratification is valid when granted to the person making the proposal.\n (3) If the spouse without whose consent the transaction was entered into does not grant ratification within two weeks after receipt of the proposal specified in subsection 2 of this section, the spouse is deemed not to have ratified the transaction.\n (4) Until ratification of a transaction, the declaration of intention made by the other party for entry into the transaction may be withdrawn. If the other party was aware of the jointness of property, he or she shall not withdraw the declaration of intention if upon entry into the transaction he or she knew or should have known that the other spouse had not granted consent.\n\n",
