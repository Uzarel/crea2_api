If one spouse disposes of a movable or a right which forms part of the joint property of the spouses, consent of the other spouse is presumed. A spouse may, without the consent of the other spouse, enter into transactions with respect to joint property for the satisfaction of everyday needs of himself and herself and the family.\n (2) A marital property contract may prescribe that consent of a spouse is not required in the case of transactions entered into in independent economic activities of the other spouse.\n (3) If it is not possible to obtain consent from one spouse primarily due to illness or absence of the spouse or he or she refuses to grant consent required for entry into a transaction with respect to joint property without adequate reason, consent may be granted by a court in proceedings on petition on the basis of an application of the other spouse if failure to enter into the transaction or delay in entry into the transaction causes the risk of damage.\n (4) A transaction entered into on the basis of subsection 1 of this section becomes a solidary obligation of the spouses. Both spouses are solidary obligees with respect to the obligated party of the transaction.\n\n",
