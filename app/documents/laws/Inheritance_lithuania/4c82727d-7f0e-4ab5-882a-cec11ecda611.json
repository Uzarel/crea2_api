If the subject-matter of a testamentary exclusion is an object characterised by individual characteristics, the beneficiary of the testamentary exclusion who accepts the exclusion shall acquire ownership of such object as from the moment of acceptance of the estate. The object shall pass from that moment to the recipient of the testamentary exclusion, with all the rights and obligations relating to that object which belonged to the deceased. The beneficiary of the testamentary exclusive shall also be entitled to the dependencies of the main object.\n2. If the subject-matter of the testamentary exclusion consists of claims under obligations, the beneficiary of the exclusion shall also be entitled to any additional claims which should have been settled before the moment of the death of the deceased.\n3. If the subject-matter of a testamentary exclusion consists of movable property characterised by its kind, the testamentary exclusion shall be executed irrespective of whether the estate contains such property. Where there are several such items, the right of option shall be vested in the recipient of the testamentary exclusion, unless otherwise provided in the will.\n4. The testator shall have the right to oblige the heir to whom an immovable property (land, house, apartment, etc.) or a sole proprietorship (partnership) passes to give to another person the use of the immovable property or a part of it, or the transfer of the income or a part of the income derived from the property, for a certain period of time, or for his life.\n5. If the testator has by testamentary exception granted maintenance to a person without specifying its content, such person shall be entitled to food, lodging, clothing and medical care, and, in the case of those who are in education, to reimbursement of the costs of education for the duration of their education, but not beyond the age of twenty-four years.\n\n",
