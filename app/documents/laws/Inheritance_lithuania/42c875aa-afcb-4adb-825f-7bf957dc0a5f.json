The testator shall have the right to oblige the testamentary heir to perform an obligation (testamentary exclusivity) for the benefit of one or more persons, who shall be entitled to claim the performance of that obligation. The beneficiaries of the exclusive interest may be both heirs at law and other persons.\n2. The heir obliged by the testator shall discharge the testamentary exclusive within the limit of the value of his estate, after satisfaction of the claims of the creditors of the deceased.\n3. If the testamentary heir who is obliged to make a testamentary exception is entitled to a reserved share of the estate, he shall make the testamentary exception up to the value of his own estate, which is greater than his reserved share.\n4. If the heir who was obliged to fulfil the testamentary exception dies before the succession occurs or does not accept the succession, the obligation to fulfil the testamentary exception shall pass to the other heirs who have received the heir's share.\n5. If the testamentary exclusion is not specified in the will, the testamentary exclusion shall be excluded from the estate until the heirs' shares of the estate are determined.\n6. A testamentary exclusion shall be null and void if the recipient dies before the succession has occurred.\n\n",
