The successor to such property may be a legal person to be established in pursuance of the testator's will. The testator may oblige the heir or the executor of the will to establish such a legal person.\n2. If the heir or the executor of the will does not take steps to set up a legal person, the persons concerned may apply to the court for the appointment of an administrator for the estate and for an order that the latter set up the legal person provided for in the will.\n3. If the public need for which the property was intended has ceased to exist or if the property cannot be used for the purpose stated in the will and there are no instructions from the testator as to what should be done with the property in such a case, the question of the further use of the property shall be determined by the court of the place of the succession. Such assets must be used for purposes similar to those indicated by the testator.\n\n",
