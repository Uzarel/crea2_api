Every natural person may bequeath all or part of his/her property (not excluding the usual household furnishings and utensils) to one or more persons, whether or not heirs at law, as well as to the State, to municipalities and to legal persons.\n2. The testator may leave all or part of his/her property to the legal persons to be created in execution of the will, as well as to natural persons not yet begun or not yet born.\n3. The testator may, by his will, deprive one, several or all of his heirs of the right of succession.\n4. If the testator has not specified the share of the estate to be bequeathed to each of the heirs under the will, the estate shall be divided equally among them.\n5. If the property to be inherited is distributed in the will in such a way that all the shares taken together exceed the amount of the whole estate, the share of each heir shall be reduced accordingly.\n6. If the sum of the shares is less than the amount of the whole estate, the shares of the testators shall be increased proportionately, taking into account the contents of the will, or the remainder shall be inherited according to law.\n\n",
