In the latter case, the legatee, by achieving the abandoned disposable, does not acquire the status of heir.\nThe legitimates have the same choice when the testator has disposed of the bare ownership of a portion in excess of the available portion.\nIf there are more legitimates, the agreement of all is required for the testamentary disposition to be executed.\nThe same rules also apply if of the usufruct, annuity or bare property was disposed of by gift.\n\u00a0\n",
