This provision does not apply to the heir who has accepted with the benefit of inventory and who has forfeited it.\nIn any case, the legitimary, who applies for the reduction of donations or testamentary dispositions, must impute to his or her legitimate portion the donations and legacies made to him or her, unless he or she has been expressly dispensed from them.\nA legitimary who succeeds by representation must also impute donations and legacies made, without express dispensation, to his ascendant.\nThe dispensation has no effect to the detriment of prior donees.\n\n",
