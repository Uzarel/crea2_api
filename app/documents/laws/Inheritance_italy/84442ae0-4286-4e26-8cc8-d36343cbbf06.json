In the latter case, the honoree is obliged to acquire ownership of the thing from the third party and to transfer it to the legatee, but it is within his power to pay the legatee a fair price for it.\nIf, however, the thing legated, although belonging to others at the time of the will, is in the testator's ownership at the time of his death, the legacy is valid.\n\n",
