The latter is obliged to give things of no less than average quality; but if there is only one of the things belonging to the genus specified in the estate, the honoree has no right nor can he be obliged to lend another, unless the testator expressly provides otherwise.\nIf the choice is left by the testator to the legatee or a third party, they must choose a thing of average quality; but if things of the kind indicated are found in the estate, the legatee might choose the best.\nIf the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made in accordance with the third paragraph of ART631 (If the honored person or the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made by decree by the president of the court of the place where the succession was opened, after taking appropriate information.).\n\n",
