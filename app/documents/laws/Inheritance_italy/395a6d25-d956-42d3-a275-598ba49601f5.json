If more than one person is named alternatively and it is not determined who is to make the choice, it is deemed to be left to the honored person.\nIf the honored person or the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made by decree by the president of the court of the place where the succession was opened, after taking appropriate information.\n\n",
