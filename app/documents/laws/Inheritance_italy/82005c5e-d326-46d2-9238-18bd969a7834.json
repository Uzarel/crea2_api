Even if it is not made indicating the first and last name, it is nevertheless valid when it designates with certainty the person of the testator.\nThe date must contain an indication of the day, month and year. Evidence of the untruthfulness of the date is allowed only when it is a matter of judging the testator's capacity, priority of date among several wills or other matter to be decided by the time of the will.\n\n",
