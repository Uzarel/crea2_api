Likewise, the division might not take place during the pendency of a judgment on the filiation of the person who, in the event of a favorable outcome of the judgment, would be called to succeed, nor might it take place during the conduct of the administrative procedure for the admission of the recognition provided for in the fourth paragraph of ART252 or for the recognition of the entity established as heir. (1)\nHowever, the judicial authority might authorize the division, setting appropriate precautions.\nThe provision of the preceding paragraph shall also apply if there are unborn unconceived children among those called to the estate.\nIf unborn unconceived children are instituted without determination of shares, the judicial authority might allocate all or part of the hereditary property to the other coheirs, according to the circumstances, ordering appropriate precautions in the interest of the unborn children.\n\n",
