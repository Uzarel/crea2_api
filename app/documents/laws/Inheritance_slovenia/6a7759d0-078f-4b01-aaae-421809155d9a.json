Such a dispossession shall remain valid only when the heir dispossessed of his or her statutory portion has, at the time of inheriting, an underage child or a grandchild by a previously deceased child, or if he or she has a child of full age or a grandchild of full age by a previously deceased child, and this child or grandchild has no earning capacity.\n \n",
