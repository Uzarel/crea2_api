A negligible difference in an individual spouse\u0092s contribution to co-owned property shall not be taken into consideration.\n(2) In a dispute on the amount of each spouse's share in co-owned property, a court shall consider not only the circumstances of the case but also the income of each spouse, the assistance that the spouses provide to each other, the care and upbringing of children, performing household work, care for home and family, concern for maintaining the property, and any other form of work and cooperation in managing, maintaining and increasing the co-owned property.\n\u00a0\nFAMILY ",
