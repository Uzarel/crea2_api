Paragraph two of Article 74 of this Code shall apply to the dispute referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n(5) In civil bankruptcy proceedings against a spouse the other spouse may notify the right of exclusion in which they claim that their share in co-owned property is larger. If the other spouse fails to make such notification, in the civil bankruptcy proceedings such spouse shall be deemed to have notified the right of exclusion on the share of common property that is equal to one half.\n\u00a0\nFAMILY ",
