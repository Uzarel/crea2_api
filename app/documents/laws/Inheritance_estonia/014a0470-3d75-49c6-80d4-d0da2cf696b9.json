If spouses have made dispositions reciprocally for the benefit of one another or designated to whom the estate of the surviving spouse or other proceeds received on the basis of the reciprocal will transfer, it is presumed that the disposition would not have been made without the disposition of the other spouse.\nA reciprocal will of spouses shall be made in a notarially authenticated form.\n\n",
