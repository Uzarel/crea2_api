If a term is not agreed to or the term is longer than ten years, the term shall be deemed to be ten years after the date of opening of the succession.\nAn estate shall not be divided during the term specified by the will or succession contract unless the successors agree otherwise. If division of an estate is prohibited by the will or succession contract without specifying a term or if the term is longer than thirty years, the term shall be deemed to be thirty years after the date of opening of the succession.\n\n",
