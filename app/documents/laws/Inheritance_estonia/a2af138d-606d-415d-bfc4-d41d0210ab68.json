    "content": " ACT\n105.  \nSize of compulsory portion\nA compulsory portion is one-half of the value of the share of an estate which a successor would have received in the case of intestate succession if all intestate successors would have accepted the succession. The persons who renounce a succession by a contract shall not be taken into account upon determining the size of a compulsory portion.\nIf a person entitled to claim a compulsory portion has been bequeathed a share of an estate which is smaller than a compulsory portion, he or she may claim the deficient share as a compulsory portion from the co-successors.\nIf one from several successors has the right to receive a compulsory portion, he or she may refuse to satisfy the claim of some other person entitled to compulsory portion to such extent that he or she would receive his or her compulsory portion. Other successors shall be liable for the deficit.\nIf a legacy is given to a person entitled to a compulsory portion, he or she has a claim for the compulsory portion only in case he or she renounces the legacy. If the value of a legacy is lower than a compulsory portion, the person may claim a compulsory portion from the successors to the extent which he or she received less as legacy than he or she would have received as a compulsory portion.\n\n",
