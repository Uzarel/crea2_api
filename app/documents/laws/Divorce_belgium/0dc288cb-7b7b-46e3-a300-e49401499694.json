The agreement thus recorded and signed by the parties binds them definitively and empowers the liquidating notary, where it relates to the public or private sale of all or part of the assets, to proceed with the said sale if so requested by at least one of the parties.\nIn the case of a public sale, the sale shall take place in accordance with what is customary for ordinary public sales of immovable property and in accordance with article 1193, paragraphs 2 to 8, and, where applicable, in accordance with articles 1186 to 1192.\nIn the case of a private sale, it takes place, where applicable, in accordance with article 1193bis.\nThe sale of the movable property takes place in accordance with Articles 1194 to 1204bis, where applicable with the intervention of a bailiff appointed by the liquidating notary.\nOn the day indicated for the auction, it is carried out at the request of at least one of the parties.\n2.The liquidating notary carries out the inventory unless all the parties, insofar as they are capable, waive it by indicating jointly to the liquidating notary which assets are included in the assets to be divided. The inventory is waived at the latest when the minutes of the opening of operations are closed. The liquidating notary draws up a record of the parties' waiver of the inventory and of their agreement as to the determination of the assets to be divided and communicates a copy thereof to the parties and their advisers in the manner provided for in Article 1215, \u00a4 2.\n3.In the absence of a waiver of the inventory, the liquidating notary fixes, at the time of the closure of the minutes of the opening of the operations, the day and time at which the first inventory session will take place, which takes place, unless all the parties and the liquidating notary agree otherwise, at the latest within two months of the said closure. If the inventory cannot be closed at the first session, the liquidating notary shall immediately set the date and time of the next session, which shall take place, unless all the parties and the liquidating notary agree otherwise, at the latest within two months of the previous session.\nWith the agreement of all the parties, provided they are capable, the inventory may be made on the basis of declarations.\nIf he agrees at the request of all the parties, the liquidating notary estimates the assets to be divided.\n4.Without prejudice to the rules relating to the burden of proof, the liquidator-notary may request all relevant information and documents from the parties or third parties.\nIf the parties or third parties fail to communicate the relevant information and documents requested by the liquidating notary, the court, seised in accordance with Article 1216, may order their production in accordance with Articles 877 to 882, where applicable under penalty of a fine.\n5. The liquidator-notary proceeds with the accounts which the co-partitioners may owe each other, with the formation of the general mass, with the composition of the lots and with the allocations to be made to each of the co-partitioners. He takes any other additional measures in order to properly accomplish his mission within a reasonable time.\n6.The absence of one or more parties does not prevent the procedure from continuing. Where applicable, the liquidating notary notes, at any stage of the procedure, the absence or refusal to sign of a party.\nNotwithstanding a party's absence or refusal to sign, the liquidating notary receives the auction prices and other claims in principal and accessories, discharges them with or without subrogation and, as a consequence of these payments, discharges any registration made or to be made, any transcription of a summons and seizure, as well as any opposition if applicable.\n7. The liquidating notary draws up, in a liquidation statement, the draft partition which he submits to the parties in accordance with the procedure defined in article 1223. He complies with the global or partial agreement referred to in articles 1209, \u00a4 1, or 1214, \u00a4 1, paragraph 2, reached, if applicable, between the parties. \n\n",
