    "content": " PROCEDURE CODE\n1223\nPrior to the allocation of the lots, where applicable determined by the expert, each undivided co-owner may formulate his objections to the liquidation statement containing the draft partition referred to in article 1214, \u00a4 7, and, where applicable, make observations and put forward arguments with regard to the final expert report.\nTo this end, the liquidator-notary summons the parties and other interested parties by bailiff's writ, by registered letter or against dated acknowledgement of receipt, as well as their advisers by ordinary mail, fax or electronic mail, to acquaint themselves with the liquidation statement containing the draft partition referred to in Article 1214, \u00a4 7, annexed to the said summons and, where applicable, with the final expert report previously communicated to them by the expert in accordance with Article 1213, \u00a4 2. At the same time, the liquidator-notary summons the parties and other interested parties to the allocation of the lots and the closing of the transactions, which will take place at the place, day and time set by the liquidator-notary.\nIn his summons, the notary-liquidator warns the parties that the lots will be allocated in their absence or in their presence, where applicable by drawing lots or, in the event of disagreement on the formation of the lots or on the liquidation statement containing the draft partition referred to in article 1214, \u00a4 7, by drawing up the minutes of the disputes or difficulties referred to in article 1223, \u00a4 3.\nUnless all the parties agree on the time limit which follows, the parties have a period of one month from the date of the summons to inform the liquidating notary and the other parties in writing of their objections to the liquidation statement containing the draft partition referred to in Article 1214, \u00a4 7, and, where applicable, of their observations on the final expert report giving rise to the said objections.\nIn the absence of objections formulated within the time limits and in the form referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 4, the liquidating notary proceeds, at the time of the closure of the operations referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 2, to the allocation of the lots in accordance with the agreement of all the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by drawing lots and signs, with the parties appearing, the closing minutes.\nThe deed of partition is final as an amicable partition, without prejudice, where applicable, to the application of article 1206, paragraphs 5 and 6.\nWhere objections have been raised within the time limits and in the form referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 4, the liquidating notary draws up, instead of the closing of the operations referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 2, a record of the disputes or difficulties containing a description of all such objections.\nDisputes may not affect agreements entered into in accordance with Article 1209, \u00a4 1 or Article 1214, \u00a4 1, paragraph 2.\nIn the case of observations or objections sent successively to the liquidating notary by the same party, the latter only takes into account the last observations or objections communicated to him within the time limits referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 4.\nUnless otherwise agreed by all the parties and the liquidating notary, the latter shall serve on the parties by bailiff's writ or send them by registered letter or deliver to them against a dated acknowledgement of receipt, as well as to their advisers by ordinary mail, fax or electronic mail, a copy of the minutes referred to in paragraph 1 as well as his written opinion on the disputes or difficulties, within two months from the expiry of the period referred to in \u00a4 1, paragraph 4.\nAt the same time, the liquidating notary deposits at the Registry a copy of the minutes of the disputes or difficulties, of his written opinion, of the minutes of the opening of the operations and of all subsequent minutes and of the inventory, a copy of the inventory of the parties' documents, as well as a copy of the liquidation statement containing the draft partition referred to in Article 1214, \u00a4 7.\nThis filing shall bring the matter before the court. The clerk's office summons the parties by judicial letter and their advisers by ordinary mail, fax or electronic mail, for a hearing at which the parties are heard on the basis of their objections formulated in accordance with \u00a4 1, which take the place of pleadings, without prejudice to the possibility of postponing the case to a later hearing or of applying, in view of the complexity of the dispute, article 747. \nThe court settles the disputes or difficulties, simply approves the statement of account containing the draft partition or sends it back to the liquidating notary to draw up, within the time limits it fixes, a supplementary statement of account or a statement of account in accordance with its instructions.\nUnless all the parties agree otherwise or subject to the occurrence of new facts or the discovery of new decisive documents, the court only hears disputes or difficulties arising from the contradictions recorded in the minutes referred to in \u00a4 3, paragraph 1.\nIn the event of homologation of the liquidation statement containing the draft partition, the Registrar notifies the liquidating notary of the decision reached. The liquidating notary deposits the final decision in his minutes.\nIn the event of the drawing up of a liquidation statement containing a supplementary draft partition or of a liquidation statement containing a draft partition in accordance with the court's directives, the liquidating notary summons the parties and other interested parties by bailiff's writ, by registered letter or against a dated acknowledgement of receipt, as well as their counsels by ordinary mail, fax or electronic mail, to acquaint themselves with such statement, which he attaches to the said summons. The liquidating notary shall at the same time summon the parties and other interested parties to the closing of the transactions, which shall take place at the place, on the day and at the time that he shall determine.\nUnless all the parties agree otherwise as to the time limit that follows, they have a period of one month from the date of the summons to inform the liquidating notary and the other parties in writing of their objections to the statement. Article 1223, \u00a4 3, paragraph 3, is applicable.\nUnless new decisive facts or documents are discovered, the objections may only relate to disputes or difficulties connected with the adaptation of the statement of affairs in accordance with the instructions of the court or, as the case may be, to new disputes or difficulties resulting from the said adaptation.\nWhere objections have been raised within the time limits and in the form referred to in paragraph 2, the liquidating notary shall draw up minutes of the disputes or difficulties containing a description of all such objections. The procedure continues in accordance with article 1223, \u00a4 3, paragraphs 4 to 6.\n\n",
