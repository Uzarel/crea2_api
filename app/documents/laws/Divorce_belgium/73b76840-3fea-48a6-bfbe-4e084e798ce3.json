    "content": " PROCEDURE CODE\n1220\nUnless all the parties agree or new decisive facts or documents are discovered, the liquidating notary does not take into account claims, observations and documents communicated after the expiry of the time limits agreed pursuant to Article 1217 or set in Article 1218, \u00a4\u00a4 1 and 2.\nIf the liquidating notary does not act within the time limits agreed pursuant to Article 1217 or fixed by law, each of the parties may, by simple letter filed with or addressed to the court which designated the liquidating notary, request that the liquidating notary and the parties be summoned.\nThe court registry shall notify the parties and the liquidating notary of this request by judicial letter.\nWithin fifteen days of this notification, the liquidating notary shall, if necessary, send his observations to the court and to the parties.\nOnce this period has elapsed, the court clerk's office convenes the parties and the liquidating notary by judicial letter for a hearing in chambers.\nThe judge hears the liquidating notary and the parties, determines at this hearing, in consultation with the liquidating notary, the timetable for the continuation of the operations and decides on the replacement of the liquidating notary, which cannot be pronounced if all the parties oppose it. This decision is not subject to appeal.\nIf the replacement is pronounced for the reasons referred to in the first paragraph, the registry notifies the decision to the chamber of notaries of the company to which the liquidating notary belongs, which determines whether a disciplinary penalty should be pronounced, as provided for in article 96 of the law of 16 March 1803 containing the organisation of the notarial profession.\nThe same request may be made when, in the event of the appointment of two liquidating notaries, they cannot act jointly.\nIn such a case, the court, if it orders the replacement of the liquidating notaries, appoints another liquidating notary.\n\n",
