    "content": " PROCEDURE CODE\n1171\n In the event of absolute necessity, the justice of the peace may, by way of derogation from Article 1168, order, on application, the temporary unsealing of seals, subject to reinstatement of his own motion as soon as the cause for which the unsealing was allowed has ceased. The Justice of the Peace determines, if necessary, the measures intended to safeguard the rights of the interested parties while the seals are unsealed.\nIn the same case, final unsealing may be ordered, in whole or in part, on condition that an inventory is made immediately.\nThe Justice of the Peace shall state in his order the circumstances justifying the measure; he shall appoint a notary to represent the persons not present and a notary to draw up the inventory and ensure that the objects are preserved.\n\n",
