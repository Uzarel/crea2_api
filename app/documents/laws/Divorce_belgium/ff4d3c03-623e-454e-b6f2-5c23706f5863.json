    "content": " PROCEDURE CODE\n1208\nIf several claimants separately apply for partition of the same indivision, the applications are joined, if necessary ex officio, at the first useful hearing.\nIf there exists between the parties another indivision which does not involve a third party and the prior liquidation of which is necessary to achieve the partition sought, the application extends ipso jure to the liquidation of that indivision.\nIn the case referred to in \u00a4 2, the judgment rendered in accordance with Article 1209 implies ipso jure that it is necessary to proceed with the liquidation of the undivided co-ownership whose prior liquidation is necessary to result in the partition ordered.\nAt the request of one of the parties, the court may, by reasoned decision, order a separate partition for the property situated abroad which it designates. It takes into account the nature and location of such property. In this case, the time limits referred to in articles 1214, \u00a4 2, and 1218 do not apply to this separate partition.\nThe court may order the same in the course of the proceedings, if this request is made to it by the liquidating notary in accordance with article 1216.\n\n",
