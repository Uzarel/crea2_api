    "content": "\nARTICLE 192 \nREFUNDS AND RETURNS\nEach of the spouses is liable to reimburse to the community any sums taken out of the community property for purposes other than the performance of the obligations provided for in Article 186. \nThe spouse is also obliged to reimburse the value of community property referred to in Art. 189 unless, being an act  of extraordinary administration performed by the spouse, he/she proves that the act was beneficial to the community or satisfied a need of the family.\nEither spouse may claim restitution of sums withdrawn from the personal assets (art. 179) and used for expenses and investments of the common property.\nRefunds and restitutions are made at the time of the dissolution of the community; however, the court may authorise them at an earlier time if the interests of the family so require or permit.\nA spouse who is a creditor may request to take common property up to the amount of his or her claim. In the event of dissent, the fourth paragraph applies. Withdrawals are made on money, then on furniture and finally on real property.\n\n",
