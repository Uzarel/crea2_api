    "content": "\nARTICLE 163 \nAMENDMENT OF AGREEMENTS\nAmendments to marriage agreements, whether before or after the marriage, have no effect unless the authentic instrument is drawn up with the consent of all the persons who were parties to the agreements, or their heirs.\nIf one of the spouses dies after having given his or her consent by authentic instrument to the modification of the agreements, the latter produces its effects if the other parties also subsequently express their consent, subject to the approval of the court. The homologation may be requested by all the persons who participated in the amendment of the agreements or by their heirs.\nThe agreed amendments and the homologation are effective towards third parties only if an annotation to that effect is made in the margin of the marriage certificate.\nThe annotation must also be made in the margin of the transcription of the marriage agreements where this is required.\n\n",
