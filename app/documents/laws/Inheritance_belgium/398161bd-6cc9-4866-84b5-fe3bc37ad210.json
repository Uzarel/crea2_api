This share is determined on the basis of the conversion tables referred to in article 4.64, \u00a4 3, and the age of the usufructuary at the date of the request. Articles 4.63, \u00a4 3 and 4.64, \u00a4\u00a4 2, 4 and 6 apply by analogy.\nWhere the bare ownership belongs to persons other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the surviving spouse may request such conversion within a period of five years from the opening of the succession.   \nIn the same case, he or she may at any time request that bare ownership of the property referred to in paragraph 7 be transferred to him or her in exchange for a sum of money. \nExcept in the circumstances provided for in paragraph 2, the family court may refuse conversion where, due to the state of health of the usufructuary, his or her probable life expectancy is manifestly less than that indicated in the statistical tables, unless the court applies art. 4.64, \u00a4 4. \nIt may also refuse the conversion of the usufruct and the allocation of full ownership if they are of such a nature as to be seriously prejudicial to the interests of a business or professional activity.\nThe court may, if it considers it equitable in view of the circumstances of the case, grant an application for conversion made by a bare owner, other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, or, after the five-year period, by the surviving spouse.\nConversion of the usufruct of property subject to the legal right of reversion can only be requested by the holder of this right.\nThe usufruct which is exercised over the immovable property assigned on the day of the opening of the succession to the principal dwelling of the family and over the furnishings which furnish it, may only be converted with the agreement of the surviving spouse.\n\n",
