In the event of a dispute over its execution, he may intervene to support its validity.\nAt the end of the year following the death of the testator, he must render an account of his management.\nThe powers of the executor do not pass to his heirs.\nIf there are several executors who have accepted, only one can act in the absence of the others. They are jointly and severally liable for the account of the movable property entrusted to them, unless the testator has divided their duties and each of them has limited himself or herself to the duties assigned to him or her.\n\n",
