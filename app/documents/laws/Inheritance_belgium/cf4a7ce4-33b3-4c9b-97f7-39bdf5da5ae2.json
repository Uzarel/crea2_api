    "content": "\n Art. 4.119. \nObligation to continue operations\nThe transferee is obliged to farm the immovable property involved in the takeover either himself or through his spouse, his descendants or adopted children or the spouses of his descendants or adopted children, within six months and for a period of ten years from the date on which the deed of takeover is signed. The transferee may only be released from this obligation for a serious reason recognised as valid by the Family Court.\nThe transferee who alleges a serious reason must submit an application to the Family Court of the judicial district in which the property with the highest cadastral income is located.\nThe clerk of the court shall summon all the parties interested in the repossession, by judicial letter, at least fifteen days in advance. The court shall grant or refuse authorisation after hearing the parties.\n If, without the authorisation of the court, the transferee fails to fulfil the obligation provided for in paragraph 1, he shall be required to pay to each of the former co-owners or their heirs compensation fixed at thirty-five per cent of their share of the purchase price.\n However, in the event of a joint takeover, each transferee may transfer the farm to a co-transferee without prior authorisation.\n\n",
