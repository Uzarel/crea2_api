This is stated in the agreement.\nThe agreement remains without effect with regard to the surviving spouse who, having the status of spouse at the time of the signing of the agreement, did not intervene to consent to it.\nWith regard to the surviving spouse referred to in paragraph 1, the gifts referred to in the agreement are, for the purposes of reduction and report, presumed to have been granted jointly to all the presumptive heirs in the direct descending line who are parties to the agreement.\n A surviving spouse who has acquired this status subsequent to the signature of the agreement may not request the reduction of the gifts included in the agreement.\n\n",
