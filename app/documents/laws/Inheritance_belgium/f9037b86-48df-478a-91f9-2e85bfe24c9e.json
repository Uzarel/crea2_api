It may make the granting of this provisional pension subject to the provision of a guarantee which it determines and the terms of which it fixes.\nThe court fixes the amount of maintenance which must cover at least the state of need of the beneficiary.\nIt takes into account the income and means of the spouses and the significant deterioration of the economic situation of the beneficiary. To assess this deterioration, the judge will take into account the length of the marriage, the age of the parties, their behaviour during the marriage in terms of organising their needs, and the care of the children during or after their life together. The judge may decide that the alimony should be degressive, and to what extent.\nAlimony may not exceed one third of the income of the debtor spouse.\nThe duration of the alimony may not exceed the duration of the marriage.\nIn exceptional circumstances, if the beneficiary demonstrates that at the expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 1, he or she remains in a state of need for reasons beyond his or her control, the court may extend the period. In this case, the amount of the pension corresponds to the amount necessary to cover the beneficiary's state of need.\nIf the defendant proves that the state of need of the claimant is the result of a decision taken unilaterally by the latter, and without the needs of the family having justified this choice, he may be exempted from paying maintenance or only be required to pay reduced maintenance.\nThe court awarding the pension notes that it is adapted by operation of law to fluctuations in the consumer price index.\nThe basic amount of the alimony corresponds to the consumer price index of the month in which the judgment or decree granting the divorce became final, unless the court decides otherwise. Every twelve months, the amount of the pension is adjusted in line with the rise or fall in the consumer price index for the corresponding month.\nThese changes are applied to the pension from the due date following publication in the Moniteur belge of the new index to be taken into account.\nThe court may, in certain cases, apply another system for adjusting the pension to the cost of living.\nUnless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise, the court may subsequently, at the request of one of the parties, increase, reduce or abolish the pension if, as a result of new circumstances beyond the control of the parties, its amount is no longer appropriate].\nLikewise, if, following the dissolution of the marriage, the liquidation-sharing of the joint property or of the undivided property which existed between the spouses leads to a change in their financial situation which justifies an adjustment of the alimony which was the subject of a judgment or an agreement entered into before the liquidation accounts were drawn up, the court may adjust the alimony.\nThe alimony may at any time be replaced, with the agreement of the parties, by a capital sum approved by the court. At the request of the debtor of the pension, the court may also grant capitalisation at any time.\nThe spouses may not waive their rights to maintenance before the dissolution of the marriage.\nThey may, however, compromise on the amount of such maintenance during the course of the proceedings.\nThe maintenance is no longer due on the death of the debtor, but the beneficiary may claim maintenance from the estate under the conditions set out in Article [3 205bis, \u00a4 1 and \u00a4\u00a4 3 to 6.\nIn any event, the pension is definitively terminated if the beneficiary remarries or if the beneficiary makes a declaration of legal cohabitation, unless the parties agree otherwise.\nThe court may terminate the pension if the beneficiary is living in a marital relationship with another person.\nThe court may decide that in the event of failure by the debtor to fulfil his obligation to pay, the beneficiary of the pension will be authorised to collect the income of the debtor or that of the property he administers by virtue of their matrimonial property regime, as well as any other sums owed to him by third parties.\nThis decision may be set up against any current or future third party debtor upon notification of the decision by the Registrar at the request of the claimant.\n\nOLD ",
