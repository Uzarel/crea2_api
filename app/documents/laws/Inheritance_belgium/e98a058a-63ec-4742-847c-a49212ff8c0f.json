    "content": "\nArt. 4.202. \nOwnership, possession and enjoyment \nAn outright legacy gives the legatee, from the day of the testator's death, a right to the bequeathed property. This right is transmissible to his heirs.\nNevertheless, a legatee by particular title may not take possession of the bequeathed property, nor claim the fruits or interest thereon, until the day of his request for delivery, made in accordance with the order set out in Article 4.196, or the day on which such delivery was voluntarily granted to him. \n3. The interest or fruits of the bequeathed property accrue to the benefit of the legatee, from the day of death, and without the legatee having made a claim in court: \n1\u00a1 where the testator has expressly declared his will in this respect in the will; \n2\u00a1 where a life annuity or pension has been bequeathed by way of maintenance.\n\n",
