    "content": "\nArt. 4.95. \nPayment of the debt which is subject to restitution The \nrestitution of debts takes place either by a lesser amount or by payment to the general body of creditors of the sum due.\n Where payment is made by deduction, the co-heirs to whom it is due deduct a portion of the same amount from the estate.\n If the report is made by deduction from the share of the co-heir who owes the sum, the debt is extinguished by confusion. If the amount to be reported exceeds the co-heir's share, the co-heir remains liable for the balance under the conditions and time limits that applied to the initial debt. Where the co-heir himself has a claim against the general body of creditors, the amount to be reported is deducted from his share only up to the amount of the balance due to the general body of creditors after compensation.\n\n",
