Property donated by the adopted person's ascendants or by the adopters or received in their succession and which ends up in kind in the succession of the adopted person who has died without issue, reverts to such ascendants or adopters or to their heirs in the descending line, subject to contribution to the debts and subject to the acquired rights of third parties.\n If the property has been sold, this right is exercised on the price, if it has not yet been paid, or if there has not yet been confusion in the adopted person's patrimony.\nThe adoptee's ascendants and the adopters also have the right of repossession that the adoptee may have had.\n\n",
