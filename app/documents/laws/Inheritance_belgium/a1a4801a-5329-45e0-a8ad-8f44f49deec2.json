    "content": "\nArt. 4.116. \nRight to repossess\n Subject to the provisions that determine the rights of the surviving spouse and the surviving legal cohabitant, each of the heirs in the direct line of descent has the right, where an estate includes all or part of a farm, to take over, on valuation, the movable and immovable property that makes up the farm.\n  An heir in the direct line of descent also has this option, subject to the same proviso, in cases where the estate does not include all or part of a farm, but does include immovable property that was part of the deceased's farm, and the heir is at that time farming the property as part of his own farm.\n  The legal representatives of a minor or protected person who have been expressly declared incapable of disposing of property by virtue of article 492/1, \u00a4 2, paragraph 3, 1\u00a1, of the former Civil Code may only exercise the right of repossession with the authorisation of the Justice of the Peace of the forum of the guardianship or administration of property.\n\n",
