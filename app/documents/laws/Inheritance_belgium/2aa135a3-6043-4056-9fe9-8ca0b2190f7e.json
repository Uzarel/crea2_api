    "content": "\n Art. 4.103. \nGuarantee\n The joint heirs remain respectively liable to each other for disturbances and evictions only if they arise from a cause prior to the partition.\n The guarantee does not apply if the type of eviction suffered has been excepted by a specific and express clause in the deed of partition. It ceases if the joint heir suffers the eviction through his own fault.\n Each of the co-heirs is personally obliged, in proportion to his hereditary share, to compensate his co-heir for the loss caused to him by the eviction.\n If one of the co-heirs becomes insolvent, the portion for which he is liable must be divided proportionally between the guaranteed party and all the solvent co-heirs.\n The guarantee of the solvency of the debtor of an annuity may only be exercised within five years of the partition.\n There is no guarantee in respect of the debtor's insolvency if it has occurred only since the partition was completed.\n\n",
