    "content": "\nArt. 4.85. \nObject of the obligation to report \nAn heir subject to the obligation to report who comes to the succession on his own account is only \nobliged to report what he himself has received from the deceased, and not what his father or mother has received, even if he has accepted the succession from the latter. Unless otherwise stipulated in accordance with paragraph 2, he does not report either what his child or descendant received.\n However, the donor's child may, either in the deed of gift or by a subsequent contract concluded with the donor and the donee, undertake to transfer to the donor's succession, insofar as he accepts it, the gift made to his own child. Articles 4.244 to 4.253 apply to this undertaking.\nThe property received by the donee's grandchild is treated, in the estate of the child who has undertaken to report it in accordance with paragraph 1, as if he or she had received it from the latter.\n\n",
