    "content": "\nArt. 4.75. \nCompensation and set-off \n If the composition of the estate does not permit the constitution of lots of equal value, their inequality is compensated by a balancing payment.\n Where the rights of the surviving spouse have been limited to the usufruct of certain property of the succession, and such property is, by the partition, attributed to the children, the latter may demand compensation for the burden of such usufruct, to the extent that it impairs their right to a reserved share of the succession.\nWhere the surviving legal cohabitant is entitled to the usufruct of certain property of the succession, and such property is, by the partition, attributed to the children, the latter may demand compensation for the burden of such usufruct, insofar as it affects their right to a reserved share of the succession.\nThe compensation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 is payable both by the beneficiaries of legacies chargeable against the available portion as provided for in Article 4.154, \u00a4 3, and by the children themselves insofar as they receive in the property of the succession, in addition to their reserve, a portion or all of the balance of the available portion. They all bear the burden of this compensation in proportion to the value of the property they receive, apart from the children's reserve.\nThe overall compensation is equal to the capitalised value of the usufruct of the surviving spouse or surviving legal cohabitant, determined as provided in Article 4.64.\n\n\n",
