This legacy is then reduced only if the reduction of the other legacies is not sufficient to reconstitute the reserve.\nDonations are never reduced until the value of all the assets included in the testamentary dispositions has been exhausted. Where such a reduction is required, it is made starting with the last gift, and so on, going from the last to the oldest.\n\n",
