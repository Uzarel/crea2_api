The extract must contain all the information required for the purpose in question.\n The deed or certificate of inheritance intended to release the deceased's assets must either be a separate deed or certificate, or be the subject of an extract in accordance with paragraph 2, drawn up or issued exclusively for this purpose and containing the information required by law. It contains the data of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1, 1\u00a1 to 5\u00a1, only insofar as these persons are entitled to these assets.\nInsofar as a deed of inheritance establishes the acquisition by reason of death, as referred to in Article 3.30, \u00a4 1, 7\u00a1, of real rights relating to immovable property, the notary or the competent office of the Administration g\u008en\u008erale de la Documentation patrimoniale may issue a literal extract which will be transcribed at the competent office of the Administration g\u008en\u008erale de la Documentation patrimoniale in whose jurisdiction the property is located, in the manner and within the time limits provided for in Article 3.31.\nThe notary or the office of the General Administration of Property Documentation may refuse to issue a deed or certificate of inheritance if the documents presented by the interested party requesting it, the declarations made and the research carried out do not enable them to ascertain with certainty the data required by paragraph 3 or required in accordance with paragraph 4 by reason of the purposes for which the deed or certificate should be issued.\nAll persons designated in the deed or certificate of inheritance are deemed to have the capacity mentioned in the deed or certificate and to be able to exercise the rights and powers attached thereto.    \nAny person acting in good faith on the basis of the information mentioned in the deed or certificate of inheritance with a person designated in that deed or certificate is deemed to be acting with a person having the capacity mentioned in that deed or certificate.\nUnless otherwise provided by law, payment of the deceased's assets shall be in full discharge if made by the debtor in good faith, either to or on the instructions of the persons designated by that deed or certificate of inheritance as being entitled thereto, or to or on the instructions of a judicial representative.\nCompliance with the provisions of this paragraph in no way exempts the debtor from any other legal obligations prescribed for the release of such assets.\nThe King may, for inheritance deeds drawn up by an official of the Administration g\u008en\u008erale de la Documentation patrimoniale: \n1\u00a1 determine the material form of the deed; \n2\u00a1 determine the procedures relating to the issue of copies and extracts of this deed; \n3\u00a1 determine the procedures relating to the legalisation of the deed; \n4\u00a1 determine additional procedures necessary to guarantee the immutability, confidentiality and conservation of the deed; \n5\u00a1 determine the material form and content of each request for an inheritance deed. It may prescribe the use of forms, the model of which it shall determine, and determine whether the application may or must be submitted in electronic form and how it is to be submitted.\nThe provisions of paragraph 1, 1\u00a1, 2\u00a1, 4\u00a1 and 5\u00a1 also apply to certificates of inheritance drawn up by the competent office of the General Administration of Heritage Documentation in accordance with this article. The King may determine that these certificates may or must be issued in electronic form, as well as the procedures for their issue].\n\n",
