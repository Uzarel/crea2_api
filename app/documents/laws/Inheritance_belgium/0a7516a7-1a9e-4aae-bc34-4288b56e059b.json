This agreement establishes the existence of a balance between these presumptive heirs having regard, in particular, to the gifts which the father or mother has granted to them respectively prior to the agreement, with or without exemption from payment, to the gifts granted under the terms of the agreement itself and, where applicable, to the situation of each of the presumptive heirs.\nIn order to establish this balance, the parties may agree to treat as gifts other benefits granted to the presumptive heirs previously or under the terms of the agreement itself.\nThe agreement may also allocate one or more presumptive heirs in the direct descending line by means of a debt payable to the parties expressly designated by the agreement.\nThe agreement mentions all the current or previous gifts and benefits taken into account and describes the balance as conceived and accepted by the parties.\nSimilarly, the father and mother may, at any time, jointly draw up the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 with all of their respective presumptive heirs in the direct line of descent.\nIn this case, the balance between the presumptive heirs in the direct line of descent referred to in paragraph 1 may be achieved in particular by taking into account the donations and advantages granted by each of the disposing parties.\n\n",
