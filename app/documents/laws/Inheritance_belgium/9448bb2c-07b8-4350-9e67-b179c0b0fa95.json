    "content": "\n Art. 4.118. \nEstimate\n If an interested party or his creditor so requests, an estimate shall be made by the Family Court, which may appoint one or more experts for this purpose. The Family Court rules on the original of the application and its order is enforceable on the original. The clerk of the court notifies the interested parties, by judicial letter, of the day and time of the expert's swearing-in and informs them of the expert's name; the expert immediately sets the day and time of his operations. The expert may not be sworn in until at least fifteen days after the date of dispatch of the judicial envelope. The interested parties who did not appear when the expert was sworn in are notified by the court clerk. Any request for the expert to be challenged must be submitted, under penalty of disqualification, at the latest when the oath is taken; the Family Court will rule on the request immediately.\n  The Tribunal shall appoint one of its members to rule as provided below on any disputes arising from the takeovers.\n  If there is any dispute as to how to proceed with the repossession, or if one of the interested parties refuses to consent or is not present, the judge appointed for this purpose shall summon the interested parties or their legal representatives, at least fifteen days in advance, by judicial letter. On the date set, the interested parties meet under the chairmanship of the judge who issued the summons. The meeting may be cancelled even in the absence of one or more of the parties concerned. If necessary, the judge presiding over the meeting appoints a notary to replace those absent, receive their shares and discharge them; the notary's fees are payable by the parties he represents. The judge clears up any disputes and refers the parties, for the execution of the deed, to the notary designated by them or to a notary appointed ex officio, if the parties do not agree on the choice.\n\n",
