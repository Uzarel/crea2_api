    "content": "  \nArt. 4.109.\n Prohibition on temporary alienation\n Except for a serious reason previously recognised as valid by the Family Court, the transferee may not, for a period of five years from the date on which the deed of transfer is signed, dispose of the immovable property that is the subject of the transfer.\n The transferee who alleges a serious reason must submit an application to the Family Court of the judicial district in which the property with the highest cadastral income is located.\n  The clerk of the court shall summon all the parties interested in the repossession by judicial letter at least fifteen days in advance. The court shall grant or refuse authorisation after hearing the parties.\n  If the transferee disposes of all or part of the property without authorisation, he shall be required to pay to each of the former co-owners or their heirs an indemnity fixed at twenty per cent of the sum received by them as the price of the acquisition.\n  The same applies, in the case of a joint takeover, if one of the purchasers disposes of his undivided rights to a person other than a co-taker without prior authorisation.\n\n",
