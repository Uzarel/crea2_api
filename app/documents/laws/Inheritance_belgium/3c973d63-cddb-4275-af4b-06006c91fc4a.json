Article 410, \u00a4 1, 10\u00a1, of the former Civil Code applies.\nA person who, on the basis of article 492/1, \u00a4 2, of the former Civil Code, has been declared incapable of entering into an agreement as to succession, may nevertheless enter into the agreement, with all the effects attached thereto, after having been authorised to do so, at his or her request, by the justice of the peace referred to in article 628, 3\u00a1, of the Judicial Code. The Justice of the Peace judges the capacity of the protected person to express his or her wishes.\nIn the absence of the authorisation referred to in the first paragraph, the protected person may only be a party to a contract of inheritance in the capacity of presumptive heir; the said contract may not, however, entail, on the part of the protected person, renunciation of rights in an unopened succession.
