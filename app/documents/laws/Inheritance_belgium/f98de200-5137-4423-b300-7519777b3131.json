    "content": "\n Art. 4.120. \nProhibition on temporary alienation\n Except for a serious reason previously recognised as valid by the family court, the transferee may not, for a period of ten years from the date on which the deed of transfer is signed, dispose of the immovable property that is the subject of the transfer.\n The transferee who alleges a serious reason must submit an application to the Family Court of the judicial district in which the property with the highest cadastral income is located.\n The clerk of the court shall summon all the parties interested in the repossession, by judicial letter, at least fifteen days in advance. The court shall grant or refuse authorisation after hearing the parties.\n If the transferee disposes of all or part of the property without authorisation, he or she shall be required to pay each of the former co-owners or their heirs compensation set at a flat rate of thirty-five per cent of their share of the purchase price.\n However, in the event of a joint takeover, each shareholder may transfer his or her undivided rights to a co-shareholder without prior authorisation.\n\n",
