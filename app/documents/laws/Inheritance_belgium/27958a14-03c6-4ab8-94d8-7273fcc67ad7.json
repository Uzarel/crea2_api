This rule does not apply to dispositions permitted to fathers and mothers and to brothers and sisters, in sub-title 6. \u00a4 2 A disposition by which a third person is called upon to receive a gift, in the event that the beneficiary does not receive it, is not regarded as a gift with a charge of conservation in favour of another person, and is valid.\nThe same applies to a gift whereby the usufruct is given to one person and the bare ownership to another.\n\n",
