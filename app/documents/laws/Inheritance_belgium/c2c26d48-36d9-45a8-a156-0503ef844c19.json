The action for reduction is exercised in the same way as against the beneficiaries themselves and according to the order of the dates of the disposals, starting with the most recent.\nThe action for reduction may not be brought against the third parties referred to in the first paragraph by the reserved heirs who have consented, in accordance with articles 4.249 to 4.252, to the alienation of the donated property either in the deed of gift or by an express subsequent declaration. Articles 4.244 to 4.248 and 4.253 apply to the said consent.\nAn action for reduction may not be brought by the heirs subject to the reserve in respect of legacies which they have consented to be delivered in the knowledge that their reserve has been affected. However, in such a case, the other gifts may not be subject to a greater reduction than they would have been in the absence of such delivery.\n\n",
