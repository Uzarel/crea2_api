    "content": "   \n Art. 4.31. \nSplit in the succession of an adopted child\nIn the event of simple adoption, after exercise of the right of return as provided for in Article 4.25, the surplus property of the adopted child who dies without issue is divided into two equal parts between the family of origin and the adoptive family.\n In the family of origin, the adopted person's half of the estate is subject to the rules set out in articles 4.10 to 4.30.\n In the adoptive family, the other half is, subject to the rights of the surviving spouse or surviving legal cohabitant, entrusted exclusively to the adopter or half to each of the adopters or their descendants. If one of the adopters dies without issue, the other adopter or his descendants succeed to the whole.\nIf, in one of these families, no one is called upon to receive half of the estate or if the heirs all renounce the estate, the other family receives all the surplus of the adopted person's property.\nArticle 4.24 does not apply, as regards the adopted person's family of origin, to the estates of his children who die after him without issue. The share of the estate of the last of these children to die which, under the terms of Article 4.29, is attributed to the adopted person's ascendants, is divided in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4.\n\n",
