There is a tendency to form for each co-heir a lot with property of the same nature, quality and goodness.\nThe equality which must be achieved between the joint heirs is nevertheless equality in value.\n  When sharing in kind, the division of inheritances and holdings is avoided as far as possible.\n\n",
