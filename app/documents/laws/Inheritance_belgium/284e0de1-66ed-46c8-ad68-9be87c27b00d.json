The latter deposits it at the clerk's office of the court of first instance of the testator's place of residence.   \u00a4 \nOn the return of the ship to Belgium, the two originals of the will, also closed and sealed, or the original which would remain if, in accordance with paragraph 4, the other had been deposited during the voyage, are handed to the office of the Shipping Control. This office transmits them without delay to the Minister responsible for Maritime Mobility who orders their deposit, as provided for in the same paragraph 4. \nAn entry is made in the logbook, in the margin, of the name of the testator, of the handing over of the originals of the will, either in the hands of a consular agent, or to the office of Shipping Control.\nThe will is not deemed to have been made at sea, even though it was made in the course of the voyage, if, at the time it was made, the ship approached a foreign land where there is a Belgian consular agent with notarial competence. In this case, it is valid only insofar as it was drawn up in accordance with the forms prescribed in Belgium or in accordance with those customary in the countries where it was made.\nA will made at sea, in the form prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 3, is valid only if the testator dies at sea, or within three months after he has disembarked and in a place where he was able to make it again in the ordinary form.\nA will made at sea may not contain any provision in favour of the officers of the ship, unless they are relatives of the testator.\nParagraphs 1 to 9 apply to the wills of both crew members and passengers.\n\n",
