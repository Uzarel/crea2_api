    "content": "\nArt. 4.105. \nInjury\nWhere one of the joint heirs establishes, to his detriment, an injury of more than one quarter, he may bring an action against the others to supplement the share allocated to him at the time of the partition.\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties, the remainder of the share is provided in cash.\nIn order to judge whether there has been a lesion, the property is estimated according to its value at the time of the partition.\nAn action to supplement a share is permitted against any act, however called, the object of which is to put an end to indivision between co-heirs. In the case of successive partial divisions, lesion is assessed only at the close of the division.\nIf the partition, or the deed in lieu thereof, is included in a transaction, an action in supplement of a share is not admissible against that transaction.\nAn action is not allowed against a sale of a right of succession made without fraud to one of the co-heirs, at his or her own risk, by his or her other co-heirs, or by one of them.\nAn action for an additional share is time-barred after five years from the date of the partition or, in the case of successive partial partitions, from the date of the closure of the partition.\n\n  \n",
