If this balance is not sufficient to satisfy the surviving spouse of the usufruct rights granted to him or her, the balance of the usufruct due to him or her is charged against the reserve attributed to the children, each for an equal share; \n2\u00a1 where the rights of the surviving spouse have been limited to the portion determined by Article 4.147, \u00a4 1, this usufruct is first charged against the balance of the available portion, after charging against it the gifts as provided for in Article 4.154, paragraph 3. If this balance is not sufficient to satisfy the surviving spouse's usufruct rights, he or she may demand the reduction of the gifts deducted from the available portion, in the order determined by Article 4.155, paragraph 4. This reduction is made in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.150. \nIn the case referred to in paragraph 1, 2\u00a1, the surviving spouse may not charge to the children's reserve the usufruct of which he or she cannot obtain a reduction, either by application of Article 4.147, \u00a4 3, or because he or she has renounced the action for reduction.\n\n",
