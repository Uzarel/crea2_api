The heirs nevertheless retain a right of claim against the surviving spouse or legal cohabitant, up to the amount which exceeds the portion due to the latter in the context of the liquidation of the joint estate, the undivided co-ownership or the succession.   \u00a4 3 The surviving spouse or legal cohabitant may only claim a maximum amount of 5,000 euros pursuant to paragraph 1.\nThe debtor of assets deposited in a current or savings account, whether joint or undivided, of which the deceased or the surviving spouse is the holder or joint holder or of which the surviving legal cohabitant is a joint holder, shall draw the attention of the surviving spouse or legal cohabitant to this restriction, as well as to the penalty provided for in paragraph 3 in the event of non-compliance.\nA surviving spouse or legal cohabitant who, in application of paragraph 1, has withdrawn an amount in excess of half of the available credit balances or 5,000 euros shall forfeit any share in the joint estate, the joint ownership or the succession, up to the amount withdrawn in excess of that amount.\nA surviving spouse or legal cohabitant who loses any share pursuant to this paragraph is also deprived of the right to renounce the succession or accept it subject to the benefit of inventory. They remain heirs pure and simple, notwithstanding their renunciation.\n\n ",
