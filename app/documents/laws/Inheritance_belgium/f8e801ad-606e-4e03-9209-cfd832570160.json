Such maintenance is granted either in the form of a monthly life annuity fixed as would have been the annuity due, where applicable, during the lifetime of the deceased pursuant to Article 205, or in the form of a capital sum corresponding to the capitalised value of such life annuity.\nThe amount of maintenance granted in the form of a capital sum or the capitalised value of the life annuity may not exceed one quarter of the mass referred to in article 153 of the Civil Code by the line of ascendants.\nThe amount of the capital or the capitalised value of the life annuity is determined taking into account the life expectancy of the creditor as shown by the Belgian prospective mortality tables published annually by the Federal Planning Bureau and the average interest rates over the last year for linear bonds with a maturity shorter than the life expectancy of the creditor. The interest rates to be taken into account are applied after deduction of withholding tax and may not be less than 0% per annum.\n The Minister of Justice shall draw up each year, on the proposal of the Federal Planning Bureau, two tables, one for men and the other for women, enabling the amount of the capital or the capitalised value of the life annuity to be calculated in accordance with the method provided for in paragraph 3. With the exception of the first tables, these tables are established on 1st July of each year. They are published each year in the Moniteur belge.]3]2\n3 Alimony is a charge on the estate. It is borne by all the heirs and, if necessary, by the legatees by particular title, in proportion to their emolument.\nHowever, if the deceased has declared that certain legacies are to be paid in preference to others, these legacies contribute to the maintenance only in so far as the income of the others is not sufficient.\n4. if the maintenance is not deducted as a capital sum from the succession, sufficient securities must be given to the beneficiary to ensure payment of the maintenance.\n5 The time limit for claiming maintenance is one year from the date of death.\n6. The succession is exempt from the obligation referred to in \u00a4\u00a4 1 and 2 if the claimant is unworthy to come to the succession, without distinction as to whether or not he is actually called to the succession.\n\nOLD ",
