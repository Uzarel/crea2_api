All the heirs are summoned to the proceedings by judicial notice.\nWhere it grants the application in whole or in part, the court determines the terms of the conversion or the amount of the price to be paid for the transfer of the bare ownership of the property referred to in article 4.61, \u00a4 7.\nIt orders, where applicable, the sale of the full ownership of all or part of the property subject to usufruct or its partition, even if there is no indivision as to this right, unless it prefers to refer the parties to a notary to carry out the conversion operations in accordance with the procedure provided for by articles 1207 to 1225 of the Code judiciaire.\n The conversion referred to in Article 4.61, \u00a4 2 may however only be requested in the context of the liquidation-sharing proceedings, at the latest at the time of the communication of the claims referred to in Article 1218, \u00a4 1, paragraph 2, of the Code judiciaire. If the request has not been made within that period, conversion may still be requested subsequently, but the court retains the same discretion as in the case of a request for conversion based on Article 4.61, \u00a4 1. The same applies if conversion of the usufruct is requested after the amicable partition of the succession, with full or partial retention of the usufruct for the survivor.\nThe usufructuary retains the usufruct of the property until such time as the capitalised value of his usufruct is actually paid to him.\nUntil that time, this sum does not bear interest in favour of the usufructuary, unless, after the capitalised value of his usufruct has been definitively fixed, the usufructuary decides to renounce the enjoyment of the property. In this case, interest at the legal rate will be payable to the usufructuary from the moment he confirms to the bare owner, by registered letter or bailiff's writ, that he is relinquishing enjoyment of the property, and that he is putting the bare owner on notice to pay him this interest.\n\n",
