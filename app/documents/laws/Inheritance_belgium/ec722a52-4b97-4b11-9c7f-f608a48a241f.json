Nor can he/she benefit from the reduction of such gifts requested by the descendants of the deceased.   \u00a4 \nThe surviving spouse may be deprived by will of the rights referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 where, on the date of death, the spouses had been separated for more than six months and where, by a judicial act, either as plaintiff or defendant, the deceased or the surviving spouse has either claimed a separate residence from that of his or her spouse, or has applied for divorce on the basis of article 229 of the former Civil Code, and provided that since that act the spouses have not resumed living together.\nIn the case referred to in paragraph 1, the designation of a universal legatee constitutes a rebuttable presumption of the intention to deprive the surviving spouse of these rights.\nParagraphs 1 and 2 do not apply where the spouses have drawn up the agreement provided for in article 1287, paragraph 3, of the Judicial Code. This agreement produces its effects from the filing of the petition for divorce, unless the parties have decided in the agreement that it produces its effects on the day of signature.\nThe provisions of this Article may be derogated from in the case referred to in Article 2.3.2.\n\n",
