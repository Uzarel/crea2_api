    "content": " \nArt. 4.150. \nPrinciple of reduction in value \nGifts which exceed the available portion may be reduced to that portion after the opening of the succession.\nNotwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, and except in the case of the reserve referred to in Article 4.147, \u00a4 2, the reduction only takes place in value. It may however take place in kind at the request of the beneficiary.\nGifts which must be reduced for the usufruct only, but which relate to property other than that referred to in article 4.147, \u00a4 2, are also reduced in value. The reduction indemnity is equal to the capitalised value, on the date of death, of that usufruct; it is calculated by applying by analogy the provision of Article 4.64.\nBy way of derogation from paragraph 2, the full or bare ownership of legacies is reduced in kind if the beneficiary is not an heir.\n\n",
