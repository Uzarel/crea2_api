The interest rate corresponding to the highest maturity applies when the life expectancy is greater than this maturity. This interest rate is applied after deduction of withholding tax. However, the interest rate to be taken into account when establishing the conversion tables may not be less than 1% per annum. The two-year period runs from 1 May of the second year preceding the publication of the conversion tables to 30 April of the year of publication of these tables; \n2\u00a1 the Belgian prospective mortality tables published annually by the Federal Planning Bureau.\nHowever, where, due to the state of health of the usufructuary, his probable life expectancy is manifestly less than that set out in the statistical tables, and if Article 4.61, \u00a4 4, paragraph 1 has not been applied, the court may, at the request of a bare owner or the surviving spouse, disregard the conversion tables and set other conversion conditions.\nThe Minister of Justice establishes, on 1 July of each year, the conversion tables referred to in paragraph 3, subparagraph 1. In doing so, he shall take into account the parameters mentioned in paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, subparagraph 2 and the proposals sent to him by the Royal Federation of Belgian Notaries after having taken note of the results of the work of the Federal Planning Bureau and the Institute of Actuaries in Belgium.\nThe conversion tables are published each year in the Moniteur belge. These tables indicate, in relation to the age of the usufructuary, his life expectancy as well as the corresponding interest rate and value of the usufruct.\n The value of the usufruct provided by the conversion tables is equal to the difference between the value of the full ownership and the value of the bare ownership. The value of the bare ownership is equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the value of the full ownership; the denominator is equal to unity, increased by the interest rate, this sum being raised to a power equal to the life expectancy of the usufructuary. Two decimal places are used for life expectancy expressed in years, for the interest rate expressed as a percentage, and for the value of the usufruct expressed as a percentage of the value of the full ownership.\n\n",
