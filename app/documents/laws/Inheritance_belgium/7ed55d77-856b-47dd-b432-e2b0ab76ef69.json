    "content": "\nArt 4.23\nInheritance law and the right to the lease of the surviving legal cohabitant\nRegardless of the heirs with whom he comes into the succession, the surviving legal cohabitant receives the usufruct of the property used on the day the deceased's succession is opened as the family's main dwelling and the furnishings it contains.\nThe surviving legal cohabitant also exercises this right when the property mentioned in paragraph 1 is subject to a legal right of return as provided for in Article 4.24 or Article 4.25.\nThe surviving legal cohabitant who comes to the succession receives, on the death of the donor, the usufruct of the property used on the day the succession was opened as the family's main dwelling, and of the furniture which furnishes it, if the donor gave these assets with usufruct reserved, provided that the legal cohabitant already had this status at the time of the gift and that the donor remained the holder of this usufruct until the day of his death.\nThe legal cohabitant may renounce the usufruct referred to in paragraph 1. Articles 4.244 to 4.253 apply to such renunciation, where it takes place during the donor's lifetime.\nThe surviving legal cohabitant alone, to the exclusion of all other heirs, receives the right to the lease relating to the immovable affected on the day of the opening of the succession of the predeceased legal cohabitant as the principal dwelling of the family and receives the usufruct of the furniture which furnishes it.\nThe foregoing provisions do not apply where the surviving legal cohabitant is the descendant of the predeceased legal cohabitant.\nNotwithstanding any clause to the contrary, any person entitled to bare ownership may require that an inventory of the furnishings and a statement of the property used as the family's principal dwelling be drawn up.\nThe rules relating to the usufruct of the surviving spouse set out in Articles 4.22 and 4.60 to 4.64 apply by analogy to the usufruct of the surviving legal cohabitant.\n\n\n",
