This is stated in the agreement.\nHowever, the minor's consent does not have the effects described in paragraph 1, with regard to gifts granted to his presumptive co-heirs covered by the agreement, although the consent of the said co-heirs does have these effects, with regard to gifts granted to the minor covered by the agreement.\nNotwithstanding the waiver of the action for reduction referred to in the first paragraph, the value of the gifts mentioned in the agreement in accordance with Article 4.254, \u00a4 1, is included in the calculation mass referred to in Article 4.153.\nThe waiver of the action for reduction may not result in the gifts granted to third parties being subject to a greater reduction than they would have been in the absence of such a waiver.\nThe valuation of the benefits and gifts included in the agreement is final. The division thus agreed may not be contested on the grounds of injury.\n\n",
