The State must apply to the Family Court in whose jurisdiction the estate is located for the estate to be placed in possession. The court may only rule on the request after three publications and notices have been posted in the usual manner, and after hearing the King's Public Prosecutor.\nIf the State has not complied with the prescribed formalities, it may be ordered to pay damages to the heirs, if any are available.\n\n",
