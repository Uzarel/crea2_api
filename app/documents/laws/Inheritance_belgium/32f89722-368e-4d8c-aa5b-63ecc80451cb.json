This appointment is made by the Justice of the Peace of the canton in which the encumbered person is domiciled, in accordance with Article 393 of the former Civil Code and in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter IX of Book IV of the Judicial Code.\nAny encumbered party who fails to comply with paragraph 2 shall forfeit the benefit of the disposition. In this case, the right may be declared open in favour of the persons called, at the instance of either the persons called if they are of age, or their curator or legal representative if they are minors or have been declared incapable of accepting an inheritance by virtue of article 492/1 of the former Civil Code, or any relative of the persons called who are of age, minors or protected by virtue of article 492/1 of the former Civil Code, or even ex officio, at the instance of the King's Public Prosecutor at the Court of First Instance of the place where the inheritance is opened.\n\n",
