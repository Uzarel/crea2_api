Articles 4.249 to 4.253 do not apply to this contract.\nThe donor may also change the revocable or non revocable nature of the gift by will. In this case, the modification is binding on the donee only insofar as he or she accepts it after the donor's death. This acceptance has no effect on the donee's succession option as part of the donor's estate.\nThe donation is deducted, in accordance with the rules set out in article 4.154, on the date of the contract referred to in paragraph 3 or, where the modification is made by will, on the date of the donor's death.\n\n",
