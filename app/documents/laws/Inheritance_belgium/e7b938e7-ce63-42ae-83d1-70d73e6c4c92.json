    "content": " \n4.194. \nPossession and enjoyment \nWhere, at the death of the testator, there are heirs subject to the testator's rights, they are seised ipso jure, by his death, of all the property of the succession. The universal legatee is bound to ask them for the delivery of the property included in the will.\nNevertheless, in this case, the universal legatee has the enjoyment of the property included in the will, from the day of the death, if the request for delivery has been made within one year from that time. If he has not done so within this period, his enjoyment will only begin from the day of the application made to the court, or from the day on which delivery was voluntarily consented to.\nWhere at the death of the testator there are no reserved heirs, the universal legatee is seised ipso jure by the death of the testator, without being required to request delivery, if he has been designated by a notarial will.   \nIf, in this case, the will is holographic or in international form, the universal legatee is required to be sent for possession, by an order of the Family Court of the district in which the succession was opened.\nA copy of the minutes referred to in Article 4.191 together with a certified copy of the will and, in the case of a will in international form, the certificate referred to in Article 4.185, are attached to the application.\n\n",
