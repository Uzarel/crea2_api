    "content": "\nArt. 4.161. \nNecessity of acceptance \nA gift does not bind the donor and does not produce any effect until the day on which it has been expressly accepted.\nAcceptance may be made during the donor's lifetime, by a subsequent authentic instrument. In this case, the donor or the person he has appointed to represent him for this purpose, appears at the act of acceptance to take note of it. The power of attorney referred to in this paragraph must be recorded in a notarial deed.\nThe provisional acceptance referred to in the second paragraph of section 4.143 is an acceptance subject to authorization or approval that is binding on the donor, subject to such authorization or approval, as soon as it is notified to the donor. This provisional acceptance is recorded in the deed of gift or in a subsequent authentic instrument. The provision of the second paragraph applies to the provisional acceptance, to the definitive acceptance after authorisation or approval, and to their notification.\n\n",
