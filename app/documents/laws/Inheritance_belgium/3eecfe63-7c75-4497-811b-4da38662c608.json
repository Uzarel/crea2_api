Even if they wished to renounce the succession, they remain heirs pure and simple, without being able to claim any share in the property or assets concealed.\nThis penalty may not be invoked against an heir or successor who spontaneously and in good time provides accurate and complete information or rectifies false declarations.\n\n",
