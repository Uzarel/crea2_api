If the gifts and legacies are made to the spouse or legal cohabitant entitled to inherit, he/she reports them in full.\nExpenses for food, maintenance, education, apprenticeship, wedding expenses and customary gifts are not gifts. The nature of a customary gift is assessed at the date on which it is granted and taking into account the assets of the disposing party.\nOn the other hand, the report is due for what has been used for the establishment of one of the co-heirs, or for the payment of his debts.\n\n",
