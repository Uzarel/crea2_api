The share of the estate that goes to close relatives devolves equally to each of the two lines. First-degree relatives share in both lines; half-brothers and half-sisters with the same father share in the paternal line only; half-brothers and half-sisters with the same mother share in the maternal line only. If there are brothers and sisters on only one side, they succeed to the whole, to the exclusion of all other relatives in the other line.\n\n   \n",
