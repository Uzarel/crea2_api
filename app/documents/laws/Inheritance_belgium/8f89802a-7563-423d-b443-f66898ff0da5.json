They may join the succession by way of substitution.\nA person who is unworthy has no legal right of enjoyment of the property inherited by his children as a result of his unworthiness, and cannot inherit it from those children either directly or indirectly.If the property acquired by the child of an unworthy person is included in kind in the estate of that child on the death of the latter, the unworthy person is excluded from that estate in respect of that property. If the property no longer forms part of the estate in kind, the unworthy person is excluded to the extent of its value, unless and insofar as the property has been used up and its equivalent value is no longer to be found in the estate. The value of these assets is determined at the time they were received by the child.\n\n",
