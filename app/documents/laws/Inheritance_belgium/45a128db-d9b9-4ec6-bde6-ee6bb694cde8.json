A distinction is made in the direct line between the direct descending line and the direct ascending line. The first links the author with those who descend from him; the second is that which links a person with those from whom he descends.\nSuccession is referred to in the collateral line when it takes place between persons who are not descended from each other, but who are descended from a common author. Brothers and sisters and their descendants are also referred to as close collaterals. Other relatives in the collateral line are called simple collaterals.\nProximity of kinship is established by the number of generations. Each generation is called a degree.\nIn a direct line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations between the persons in that line. Thus the child is, with regard to the father or mother, in the first degree, and the grandchild in the second degree. The same applies to the father or mother in respect of their child, and to the grandfather and grandmother in respect of their grandchildren.\nIn the collateral line, degrees are counted by the number of generations, from one of the parents to the common author, and from the latter to the other parent.\nThus, brother and sister are in the second degree; uncle or aunt and nephew or niece are in the third degree; first cousins are in the fourth; and so on.\nRelatives beyond the fourth degree do not succeed, unless they are called by substitution.\n\n",
