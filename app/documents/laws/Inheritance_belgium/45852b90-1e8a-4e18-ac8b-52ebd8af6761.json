    "content": "\nArt. 4.90. \nValue to be reported \nLegacies are reported on the basis of the intrinsic value of the property bequeathed on the date of the opening of the succession.\nThe value of gifts is based on the intrinsic value of the property given on the day of the gift, indexed from that day until the date of death, according to the consumer price index of the month of the donor's death, the base index being that of the month during which the gift was made. No account is taken of the fruits produced by the property donated between the date of the donation and that of the death of the donor, nor of the advantage resulting, for the donee, from the enjoyment of the property during this period.\n Paragraph 2 is waived where the donee did not have the right to dispose of the full ownership of the donated property from the day of the donation.\nIn this case, the value of the property donated on the day of the death of the donor is deducted, if the donee acquires the right to dispose of full ownership at the time of death.\nIf the donee does not acquire the right to dispose of full ownership until after the death, the value of the property donated on the day of the death, less the value of the encumbrances that prevent the exercise of the right to dispose of full ownership, is taken into account.   \nIf the donee acquires the right to dispose of the full ownership at a date subsequent to the donation, but prior to the death of the donor, the ratio is made of the value of the property donated at that date, indexed from that day until the date of death in accordance with paragraph 2. \nThe intrinsic value of the property on the day of the donation is that mentioned in the deed or expressed on the day of the donation, unless it is manifestly unreasonable having regard to the state and situation of the property on the day of the donation.\nThe intrinsic value of the property on the day of the gift, mentioned in the deed or expressed on the day of the gift, is binding on any heir who has accepted it in the deed or by a subsequent contract concluded with the donor and the donee.\nThe donor and the donee may agree that the value of a gift referred to in paragraph 3 shall be the intrinsic value of the property on the day of the gift, indexed in accordance with paragraph 2. This value is binding on any heir who has accepted it in the deed or in a subsequent contract concluded with the donor and the donee.\n Articles 4.244 to 4.253 apply to the contract referred to in paragraph 6 and to the acceptance referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6.   \nThe declaration of the heirs referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 does not deprive them of the right to apply for reduction in accordance with Articles 4.150 to 4.157. \nEven where the property given has perished by force majeure, its value is subject to report in accordance with the preceding paragraphs.\n\n",
