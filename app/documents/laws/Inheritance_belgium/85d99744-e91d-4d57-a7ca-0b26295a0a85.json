    "content": "\nArt. 4.204. \nTerms and conditions of delivery \nThe bequeathed property is delivered with its accessories and in the condition in which it was on the day of the testator's death.\nIf, before the will or since, the bequeathed property has been mortgaged for a debt of the succession, or even for the debt of a third party, or if it is encumbered by a usufruct, the person who must pay the legacy is not bound to release it, unless he has been charged with doing so by an express provision of the testator.\nWhere a person who has bequeathed ownership of an immovable subsequently increases it by acquisitions, these acquisitions, even if they are contiguous, are not deemed, without a new provision, to form part of the legacy.\nThe same does not apply to embellishments or new constructions made on the bequeathed land, or to an enclosure which the testator has increased.\nWhere the legacy is of an unspecified kind, the heir is not obliged to give it of the best quality. Nor can he give it of the worst quality.\n\n",
