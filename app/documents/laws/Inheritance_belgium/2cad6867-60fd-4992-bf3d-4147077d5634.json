    "content": "\nArt. 4.89. \nRatio in value \nWithout prejudice to Article 4.92, the distribution takes place in terms of value, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, either by a reduction in value or by payment to the estate of the value of the property given or bequeathed. The reduction in value is made either by deduction or by deduction from the share of the debtor co-heir.\nWhere the lesser share is made by deduction, the co-heirs to whom it is due deduct a portion of equal value from the estate. The deductions are made, as far as possible, from objects of the same nature, quality and goodness as the object of the gifts reported.\nAfter these deductions, as many equal lots are made from what remains in the mass as there are co-partitioning heirs or co-partitioning stocks.\nIf the report is made by deduction from the share of the debtor co-heir, the debt is extinguished by confusion. If the amount to be reported exceeds the share of the co-heir, the report is made by payment of the surplus to the general body of creditors. Where the co-heir himself has a claim against the estate, the amount to be reported is set off against his share only up to the amount of the balance due to the estate after compensation.\n\n",
