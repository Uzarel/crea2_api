    "content": "\nArt. 4.152. \nWaiver of action for reduction \nThe reduction of gifts may not be applied for by heirs subject to the right of retention who have waived the right to apply for a reduction of the gift concerned by a unilateral declaration in the deed of gift or subsequent thereto. Articles 4.244 to 4.253 apply, by analogy, to this waiver.\nHeirs who have renounced the action for reduction may not benefit from any reduction which may be claimed by others.\nNotwithstanding the waiver of the action for reduction referred to in paragraph 1, the value of the property which was the subject of the gift is included in the calculation referred to in Article 4.153.\nThe waiver of the action for reduction may not result in the other gifts being subject to a greater reduction than they would have been in the absence of such waiver.\nThe waiver of the right to reduce the gift has no effect on whether or not the gift can be reinstated.\n\n",
