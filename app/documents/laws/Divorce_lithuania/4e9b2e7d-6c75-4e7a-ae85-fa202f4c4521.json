The court, when deciding on the legal separation of the spouses, may award maintenance to the spouse who is in need of maintenance from the other spouse who was at fault for the separation, unless maintenance is provided for in an agreement between the spouses. \n2. In deciding on the award and amount of maintenance, the court must take into account the duration of the marriage, the need for maintenance, the financial situation of both spouses, their state of health, their age, their ability to work, the unemployed spouse's employability, and any other relevant circumstances. \n3. The court may order the spouse who is obliged to provide maintenance to the other spouse to provide security for the fulfilment of this obligation. \n4. Maintenance shall be awarded in the form of a lump sum of money or in the form of a periodic monthly payment (annuity), or in the form of an award of certain property. \n5. The court's decision to award maintenance is the basis for the creation of a compulsory charge (mortgage) over the defendant's property. If the spouse fails to pay the maintenance ordered from him or her, his or her property shall be recovered in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. \n6. Where maintenance has been ordered in the form of periodical payments, in the event of a substantial change in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, either of the spouses may request that the amount of maintenance be increased or decreased or that the maintenance be terminated altogether. The periodic payments shall be indexed annually in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Government. \n\n",
