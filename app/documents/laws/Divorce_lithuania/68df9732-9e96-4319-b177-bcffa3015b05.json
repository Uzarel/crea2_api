When the court decides on the legal separation or the agreement on the consequences of the legal separation certified by the notary enters into force, the cohabitation of the spouses ends, but the other rights and obligations of the spouses remain, with the exceptions provided for by this Code. \n2. The rights and obligations of the spouses towards their minor children shall not be affected by the legal separation, except for the exceptions provided for in this Code. \n3. In all cases, the court must, when deciding on the legal separation of the spouses, decide on the division of the spouses' common property, unless these matters are provided for in the marriage contract. \n4. The legal effects of the legal separation on the spouses' property rights shall take effect as from the date on which the proceedings are brought before the court or the date on which the notarially certified agreement on the consequences of legal separation enters into force. A spouse, other than one who has been found guilty of legal separation, may request the court to declare that the legal effects of the separation on the spouses' property rights have been produced as from the date on which they effectively ceased to live together. \n5. If one of the spouses dies after the court's decision on legal separation, the surviving spouse retains all the rights which the law confers on the surviving spouse, unless the surviving spouse is found guilty of legal separation by the court. The same rule shall apply where the separation is decided by a court on the joint application of both spouses or where the separation is confirmed by notarial deed, unless otherwise provided for in the agreement between the spouses on the consequences of the separation. The surviving spouse may not inherit the deceased spouse's property. \n\n",
