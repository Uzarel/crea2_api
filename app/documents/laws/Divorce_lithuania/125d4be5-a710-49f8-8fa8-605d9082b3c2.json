The court may refuse to grant a request for annulment if, at the time of the hearing, the circumstances which, according to this Code, constituted an obstacle to the celebration of the marriage have disappeared. \n2. The court may refuse to annul a marriage contracted by a minor if the annulment would be contrary to the interests of the minor spouse or the minor children of the spouses. \n3. A marriage may not be declared a sham marriage if, while the annulment proceedings were pending, the spouses established a family relationship or cohabited for more than a year after the marriage was celebrated, or had a child together or are expecting a child together. \n4. A marriage may not be annulled after its dissolution unless the principle of monogamy has been violated or the marriage was contracted with a close relative (Articles 3.16 and 3.17 of this Code). \n5. A marriage contracted without the expression of the true intention of one of the spouses may not be annulled if, after the contracting of the marriage or after the circumstances giving rise to the annulment have come to light, the spouses have cohabited for more than one year, or they have a child in common, or are expecting a child in common. \n\n",
