The parental usufruct may not be pledged, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered, nor may it be recovered. \n2. Parents shall manage the property belonging to their minor child by mutual consent. In the event of a dispute between the parents as to the management of the property, either of them shall have the right to apply to the court for an order as to the management of the property. \n3. If the parents or one of them improperly manages the property belonging to the minor child to the detriment of the minor's property interests, the State authority for the protection of the rights of the child or the public prosecutor shall have the right to apply to the court for the removal of the parents from the management of the property belonging to the minor. If there are grounds, the court shall suspend the parents from the management of their minor child's property, revoke the parents' usufruct over the child's property and appoint another person as administrator of the minor's property. When the grounds for removal have ceased to exist, the court may authorise the parents to continue to administer the property of their minor children with usufruct. \n\n",
