If one of the spouses substantially breaches his/her matrimonial duties as provided for in this Book and his/her actions endanger the property interests of the family, the other spouse has the right to apply to the court for an injunction prohibiting the spouse from disposing of the matrimonial property without the consent of the other spouse. The term of such an injunction may not exceed two years. \n2. Transactions which a spouse was not entitled to enter into without the consent of the other spouse may be annulled on the latter's action if the third party with whom the transaction was concluded was dishonest. Such an action may be brought within the limitation period of one year from the date on which the spouse knew or ought to have known of the transaction. \n\n",
