Assets provided for in the marriage contract as personal property of the spouses may, by agreement between the spouses, be classified as community property to be divided between the spouses. \n2. The agreements provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be prohibited if they would be detrimental to the creditors of the spouse. If, as a result of such an agreement between the spouses, the creditor's claim can no longer be satisfied in full out of the spouse's personal property, the claim shall be recovered out of the spouse's share of the community property. \n\n",
