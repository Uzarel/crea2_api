The court decision shall divide the property acquired by the spouses as community property prior to the date on which the proceedings were instituted or prior to the date on which the judgment was given. \n2. At the request of one of the spouses, the court may provide that only property acquired jointly before the spouses began to separate shall be divided. \n3. The property shall be divided in kind, taking into account its value and the shares of both spouses in the community property, if such division is possible. If the property cannot be divided in kind between the spouses, the property shall be awarded in kind to one spouse, who shall also be obliged to compensate the other spouse for his or her share in cash. The choice of the method of division of the property and the division of the property in kind shall take into account the interests of minor children, the state of health or financial situation of one of the spouses or other relevant circumstances. \n\n",
