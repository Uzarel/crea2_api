Where parental authority is vested in only one parent of a minor child, the child's property shall be administered by that parent alone by usufruct. In the event of divorce or legal separation of the parents, the right to administer the property of the minor child shall be vested in the parent with whom the residence of the child has been established by a decision of the court. \n2. In the event of remarriage of the parent of a minor child, he/she shall retain usufruct over the property of the minor child, but shall be obliged to transfer to the child's account all income from the property and to keep separate accounts of fruit in excess of the costs of the child's upbringing (education, training, material provision). If the new spouse of the child's father (mother) adopts the child, he/she also acquires the right to administer the property. \n\n",
