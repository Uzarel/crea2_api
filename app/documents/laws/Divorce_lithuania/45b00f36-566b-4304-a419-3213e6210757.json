If the spouses live in a dwelling under a tenancy agreement, the spouse who concluded the tenancy agreement may not terminate the tenancy agreement early, sublet the dwelling without the other spouse's written consent, or assign the rights under the tenancy agreement. A spouse who has not consented to the conclusion of such a transaction or who has not subsequently approved it shall have the right to have it declared null and void. \n2. A spouse who owns the family home alone may not, without the written consent of the other spouse, transfer, mortgage or lease the family home. A spouse who has not consented to such a transaction or who has not subsequently approved it shall have the right to have the transaction annulled if the disputed dwelling unit has been entered in the public register as a family property. \n3. The rules provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply in the case of usufruct (i.e. the right to use another's property and to receive income, produce and fruits therefrom) and in the case of usufruct. \n\n",
