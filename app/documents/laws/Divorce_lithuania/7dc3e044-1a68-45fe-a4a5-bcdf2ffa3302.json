When deciding on the separation of the spouses, the court must determine with whom their minor children shall remain living, as well as the issues of maintenance of the children and the participation of the separated parent in the upbringing of the minor children and the arrangements for access to them. 2. If there are compelling reasons, the court may temporarily establish the children's place of residence with other persons or in a child care institution. 3. In deciding which spouse should be given the right to reside in the family home, priority must be given to the spouse with whom the minor children are staying or who is unable to work. \n4. Where the spouses have concluded an agreement on the consequences of separation (Article 3.73(2) of this Code), the court shall approve the agreement if it is not contrary to public policy or substantially prejudicial to the rights and legitimate interests of the minor children or of one of the spouses. After the court has approved the agreement, the court shall enter its contents in the judgment. \n5. If, after the judgment has become final, there has been a substantial change in the circumstances relevant to the separation of the spouses, either spouse shall have the right to request the court to reconsider the previous judgment and to decide differently on the matters listed in paragraph 1 of this Article in the light of the substantially changed circumstances. \n\n",
