    "content": "\n3.123. \nDeviation from the principle of equal shares of the matrimonial property \n1. The court may derogate from the principle of equal shares of the matrimonial property of the spouses by awarding one spouse a greater share of the property, taking into account the interests of minor children, the state of health of one of the spouses or the state of his/her financial situation, or any other relevant circumstances. The court must also take these criteria into account when deciding on the method of division of the community property. \n2. The share of the community property of the spouse who is obliged to pay maintenance to the other spouse may be reduced by the amount of the maintenance if the maintenance is awarded in a lump sum or if certain property is awarded. \n3. If, not more than one year before the commencement of the division of property proceedings, one spouse, without the consent of the other spouse, has reduced the value of an asset which is community property, either by making a gift of part of it or by increasing his or her personal property, that spouse's share of that asset may be reduced by the value of the lost community property for the purposes of determining the spouses' shares of the community property. \n4. One spouse's share of the community property may also be reduced by the amount of the family's loss of income which the family has not received as a result of the spouse's negligence or which the spouse has concealed from the family and has used for his or her own personal needs. The period for which such loss of income is to be calculated may not exceed the last five years preceding the commencement of the division of property proceedings. \n\n",
