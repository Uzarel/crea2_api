The separation ends when the court has given a decision granting the spouses' joint application for legal separation and annulling the earlier decision on legal separation. If the legal separation has been notarised, it shall end when the notary certifies the agreement on the consequences of legal separation. \n2. When the spouses resume cohabitation, their property remains separate until they conclude a new marriage contract and choose a new legal regime for their property. \n3. The end of the separation shall produce legal effects for third parties only if the spouses conclude a new marriage contract and register it in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 3.103 of this Code. \n4. If the legal separation of the spouses continues for more than one year from the date on which the judgment has become final or the agreement on the consequences of legal separation has been notarised, either of the spouses may request the dissolution of the marriage on the grounds referred to in Article 3.55(1)(1) of this Code. \n\n",
