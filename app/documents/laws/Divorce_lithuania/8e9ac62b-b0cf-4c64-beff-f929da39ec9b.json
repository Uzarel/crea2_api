A marriage contracted in violation of the conditions for the celebration of the marriage set out in Articles 3.16 and 3.17 of this Code may be declared null and void on the action of a spouse who was unaware of the obstacles to the celebration of the marriage, of the public prosecutor, or of any other person whose rights or legitimate interests have been violated by the marriage. \n2. A marriage contracted in violation of the condition for marriage laid down in Article 3.14 of this Code may be annulled on the basis of an action brought by the minor spouse, his/her parents, guardians or custodians, the State authority for the protection of the rights of the child, or the prosecutor. When the minor spouse reaches the age of eighteen, an action for annulment may be brought only by the minor spouse. \n3. A marriage contracted in violation of the condition for marriage laid down in Article 3.15 of this Code may be annulled on the action of the guardian of the spouse who is incapable of acting in this field, the guardian of the spouse who is of limited legal capacity in this field, the public prosecutor, or of any other person whose rights or legitimate interests have been affected by the marriage. \n4. A marriage contracted in violation of the condition of marriage laid down in Article 3.13 of this Code may be annulled on the action of the spouse who has not expressed his or her true intention or of the public prosecutor. If the spouse who has not expressed his or her true wishes is a minor, the action may be brought by his or her parents, guardians, custodians or the State authority for the protection of children's rights.
