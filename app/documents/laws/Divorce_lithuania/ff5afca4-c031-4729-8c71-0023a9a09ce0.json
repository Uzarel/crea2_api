Transactions concluded without the consent of the other spouse and subsequently disapproved may be set aside on an action brought by the spouse who did not consent within one year from the date on which he or she became aware of the transaction, provided that it is proved that the other party to the transaction was dishonest. \n2. Transactions which required the written consent of the other spouse or which could only have been concluded by both spouses (Article 3.92(4) of the present Code) may be declared void whether the other party to the transaction is honest or dishonest, unless one or both spouses have used fraud in concluding the transaction or have given false information to the authorities or officials keeping the public registers or other bodies or officials. In such cases, the transaction may be declared void only if the other party to the transaction is dishonest. \n\n",
