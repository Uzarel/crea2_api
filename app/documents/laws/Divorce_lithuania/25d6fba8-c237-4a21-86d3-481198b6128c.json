Property which is the separate property of one spouse shall be used, managed and disposed of by that spouse as he or she sees fit. The possession, use and disposal of property recognised by this Code as family property shall be subject to the restrictions laid down in this Book. \n2. If one spouse manages property which is his or her personal property negligently or with such unreasonableness and carelessness that the interests of the family are endangered by the loss or substantial diminution of the property, the other spouse shall have the right to apply to the court for the appointment of an administrator of the matrimonial property. The spouse who so requests may also be appointed administrator. \n3. If the circumstances which led to the appointment of an administrator cease to exist, either spouse may apply to the court for the administration of the property to be revoked. \n4. One spouse has the right to authorise the other spouse to administer property which is his/her (the first spouse's) personal property. In such a case, the provisions of the second book of this Code governing the legal relationship of representation shall apply to the property relations between the spouses. \n5. If, due to illness or other objective reasons, one spouse is unable to manage his/her own property and to contribute to the maintenance of the family household, the other spouse shall be entitled to use the personal funds and property of the spouse who is unable to manage his/her own property to maintain the family household. This rule does not apply if the spouses are separated or if the property of the spouse who is unable to manage his/her own property and to contribute to the family household is placed in administration. \n\n",
