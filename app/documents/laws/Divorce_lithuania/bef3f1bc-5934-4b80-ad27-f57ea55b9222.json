A cohabitant may not sell, give, otherwise transfer, lease, mortgage or otherwise encumber the property acquired and used by them jointly without the written consent of the other cohabitant. \n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the cohabitant is incapable of giving such consent because of his or her incapacity or if his or her consent cannot be obtained for other important reasons. In such a case, the court may authorise the conclusion of the transaction at the request of the other cohabitant.\n3. Transactions which have been concluded in breach of the rules laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article may be declared void on the action of the cohabitant who did not give his consent, unless the third person to whom the property has been transferred, pledged or leased was acting in good faith. The cohabitant has the right to bring an action for annulment within one year from the date on which he/she knew or ought to have known of the transaction. \n\n",
