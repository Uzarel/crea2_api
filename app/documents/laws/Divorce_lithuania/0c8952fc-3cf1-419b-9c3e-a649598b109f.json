The court, when deciding on the dissolution of the marriage, shall award maintenance to the former spouse who is in need of it, unless maintenance is provided for in the agreement on the consequences of the dissolution of the marriage between the spouses. A spouse shall not be entitled to maintenance if his or her assets or income are sufficient to support him or her in full. \n2. A spouse shall be presumed to be in need of maintenance if he/she is raising a minor child common to himself/herself and the former spouse, or if he/she is incapable of working because of his/her age or health condition. \n3. A spouse who, as a result of the marriage and the common interests of the family or the care of the children, has been unable to obtain a qualification (completion of studies) is entitled to claim from his/her former spouse reimbursement of the costs of completing his/her studies or of retraining. \n4. The spouse whose fault the marriage was dissolved is not entitled to maintenance. \n5. In deciding on the award and amount of maintenance, the court must take into account the duration of the marriage, the need for maintenance, the financial situation of both former spouses, their state of health, their age, their ability to work, the unemployed spouse's employability, and any other relevant circumstances. \n6. Maintenance shall be reduced or awarded only on a temporary basis or refused if any of the following circumstances apply:\n1) the duration of the marriage has not exceeded one year; \n2) the spouse entitled to maintenance has committed an offence against the other spouse or his/her close relatives; \n3) the spouse entitled to maintenance has created his/her own plight by his/her own fault; \n4) during the marriage the spouse claiming maintenance has not contributed to the enhancement of the common property or has deliberately prejudiced the other spouse's or the family's interests.\n7. The court may require the former spouse who is obliged to provide maintenance to the other spouse to provide adequate security for the fulfilment of this obligation. \n8. Maintenance may be awarded in the form of a lump sum of money or in the form of a periodic monthly payment (annuity), or it may be awarded in respect of certain property. \n9. Where a marriage has been dissolved at the request of one spouse on the ground of the other spouse's incapacity in this field or limited capacity in this field, the spouse at whose initiative the marriage was dissolved shall be liable to reimburse the costs of the treatment and care of the incapacitated spouse or the formerly incapacitated spouse, unless they are not covered by the national social security system. \n10. The court's decision to order maintenance is the basis for the creation of a compulsory mortgage on the defendant's property. If the former spouse fails to pay the ordered maintenance, his or her property shall be recovered in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. \n11. Where maintenance has been ordered in the form of periodical payments, in the event of a substantial change in the circumstances provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article, either of the former spouses may request an increase or decrease in the amount of maintenance or the termination of maintenance altogether. The periodic payments shall be payable for the lifetime of the creditor and shall be indexed annually, in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Government, to take account of inflation.\n12. Where the former spouse from whom maintenance has been ordered dies, the obligation to pay maintenance shall pass to his or her heirs to the extent of the assets of the estate, irrespective of the manner of acceptance of the estate. \n13. Where the former spouse on whom maintenance is ordered dies or a new marriage is contracted, the maintenance shall cease. In the event of death, the right to claim the arrears or unpaid maintenance shall pass to the heirs of the deceased. On remarriage, the right to claim the resumption of maintenance shall be acquired if the spouse requiring maintenance is raising a child from a previous marriage or caring for a disabled child from a previous marriage. In all other cases, the obligation of the spouse from the subsequent marriage to maintain the other spouse precedes the obligation of the spouse from the previous marriage. \n\n",
