The spouses shall use, manage and dispose of the property which is community property by common consent. 2. The consent of the other spouse shall not be required in the following cases: \n1) acceptance or refusal of an inheritance; \n2) refusal to enter into a contract; \n3) immediate measures to protect the community property; \n4) an action for the protection of the community property; \n5) an action for the protection of one's own rights in relation to the community property or for one's own personal rights which are not related to the family interest. \n3. A spouse shall be presumed to enter into a transaction with the consent of the other spouse, unless the written consent of the other spouse is required for the transaction. In exceptional cases, where delay would cause substantial damage to the interests of the family and the other spouse is unable to express his or her consent due to illness or other objective reasons, the transaction may be concluded by a spouse without the consent of the other spouse in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 3.32(2) of this Code. \n4. Transactions relating to the disposal or encumbrance of immovable property or rights in rem in the matrimonial property of the spouses, as well as transactions relating to the disposal or encumbrance of a joint venture and the disposal or encumbrance of securities which are the matrimonial property of the spouses may be concluded only by both spouses, unless one of the spouses has a power of attorney issued by the other to conclude such a transaction. \n5. Each spouse shall have the right to open a bank deposit account in his or her own name and to dispose freely of the funds therein without the consent of the other spouse, provided that the funds have not been transferred to the community of property. \n6. If a transaction is concluded without the consent of the other spouse, the spouse who did not consent to the transaction may approve the transaction within one month from the date on which he/she became aware of the transaction. The other party may refuse the transaction until the moment of approval. If the spouse does not approve the transaction within one month, the transaction is deemed to have been concluded without the consent of the other spouse. If the other party to the transaction knew that the person with whom he/she is entering into the transaction is married, he/she may only refuse the transaction if the spouse falsely stated that the consent of the other spouse to enter into the transaction existed. \n\n",
