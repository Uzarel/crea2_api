Individuals shall exercise their family rights as they see fit and shall enjoy them freely, including the right to the protection of family rights. Except as provided by law, the waiver or exercise of a family right shall not extinguish that right. \n2. In exercising family rights and fulfilling family obligations, persons shall observe the law, respect the rules of community life, the principles of good morals and act in good faith. \n3. It is prohibited to abuse family rights, i.e. to exercise them in such a way and by such means as to violate or impair the rights or legally protected interests of others or to cause damage to other persons. If a person abuses a family right, the court may refuse to protect it. \n4. Family rights shall be protected by the court, guardianship and care and other state or public institutions in the ways provided for in this Code. The court and other institutions shall endeavour to resolve the dispute amicably between the parties by mutual agreement, and shall assist the parties in every way to reach such an agreement.\n\n",
