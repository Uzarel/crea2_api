Children of parents who were married and whose marriage was subsequently annulled shall be deemed to be legitimate children of the marriage. \n2. If both spouses were in good faith, i.e. they did not know and could not have known that there were obstacles to the marriage, the marriage, although annulled, shall produce the same legal consequences for them as a valid marriage, with the exception of the right of succession. The circumstances proving the honesty of the spouse must be stated in the court's decision. ,\n\n",
