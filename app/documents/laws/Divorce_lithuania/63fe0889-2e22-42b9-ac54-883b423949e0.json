The marriage contract may be amended or terminated by common agreement of the spouses at any time in the same form as that prescribed for its conclusion. 2. The amendment or termination of the marriage contract may only be invoked against third parties if the amendment or termination of the marriage contract has been registered in the register of marriage contracts. This rule does not apply if, at the time of the conclusion of the transaction, the third parties were aware of the amendment or termination of the marriage contract. \n3. At the request of one of the spouses, the marriage contract may be amended or terminated by a court decision where the grounds for amendment or termination provided for in Book Six of this Code exist. \n4. Creditors of one or both spouses whose rights have been infringed by the modification or termination of the marriage contract shall have the right, within one year from the date on which they became aware of the modification or termination of the marriage contract, to challenge such modification or termination by way of a judicial procedure and to claim restitution of the rights infringed. \n\n",
