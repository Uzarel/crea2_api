The property referred to in Article 3.84(2) of this Code, which is the personal property of one spouse, may be used, possessed or disposed of only in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Article. \n2. A spouse who is the owner of an immovable property classified as family property may only transfer, mortgage or otherwise encumber it with the written consent of the other spouse. Spouses with minor children must ensure that a transaction involving immovable property constituting family property does not deprive a minor child of his or her home and does not violate the child's right to the living conditions necessary for his or her physical, mental, spiritual and moral development. Before approving this transaction, the notary shall, in accordance with the procedure established by the Law on Notaries of the Republic of Lithuania, assess whether the conclusion of this transaction will not leave the minor child without a dwelling and whether his/her right to living conditions necessary for his/her physical, mental and moral development will not be violated. \n3. The family property may not be recovered from creditors' claims if the creditors knew or ought to have known that the conclusion of the transaction was not related to the satisfaction of the family's needs and was contrary to the interests of the family. \n4. The spouses may not change the legal regime of the family property or its composition by contract. \n\n",
