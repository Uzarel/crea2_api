In order to divide the property acquired and used jointly by the cohabitants in the cases referred to in Article 3.232 of this Code, the court shall determine the property acquired and used jointly by the cohabitants and the separate property of each. When the property acquired and used jointly by the cohabitants is determined, the joint debts incurred by the cohabitants after the end of their cohabitation shall be deducted. \n2. The remaining jointly acquired and used property, after deduction of the cohabitants' joint debts, shall be divided equally between them, except for the exceptions provided for in this Article. \n3. The court may derogate from the principle of equal shares if, having regard to the interests of the minor children of the cohabitants, the length of the cohabitants' cohabitation, their age, their health, their financial situation, their personal contribution to the accumulation of the common property, and any other relevant circumstances, it would be just and reasonable to award a greater share to one of the cohabitants. \n4. A dwelling-house or an apartment may be left to the cohabitant who, having regard to his or her age, health, financial situation, the interests of his or her minor children and other relevant circumstances, has a greater need for it. In such a case, the share of this cohabitant in the other property is reduced. If the value of the dwelling-house or apartment exceeds the share of the cohabitant to whom it is awarded, he or she must pay the other cohabitant a monetary compensation. \n5. A dwelling-house or flat which belonged to one cohabitant before the beginning of their cohabitation may be left to the other cohabitant by usufruct if the latter has minor children in common or, for reasons of health, age or other serious circumstances, does not have a place of his or her own residence. \n6. Other property not provided for in Article 3.230 of this Code, which has been acquired or maintained with the resources of both cohabitants, shall be divided in accordance with the rules of community of property. \n\n",
