Each spouse has the right to enter into transactions necessary for the maintenance of the family household and for the upbringing and education of the children. The spouses shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations arising out of such transactions, irrespective of the legal status of their property, unless the transaction price is manifestly excessive and unreasonable. \n3. A joint and several obligation does not arise if one spouse, without the consent of the other spouse, takes out a loan or buys goods on hire purchase where this is not necessary for the common needs of the family. \n4. The spouses must exercise the same degree of care and diligence in assuming and discharging obligations relating to the satisfaction of family needs as they exercise in assuming and discharging their personal obligations. \n\n",
