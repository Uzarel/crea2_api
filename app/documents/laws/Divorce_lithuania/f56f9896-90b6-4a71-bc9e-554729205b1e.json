If the divorce is sought on the application of one spouse, the conciliation measures provided for in Article 3.54 of this Code shall not apply. \n3. The court may refuse to dissolve the marriage, taking into account the age of one of the spouses, the duration of the marriage and the interests of the spouses' minor children, if the dissolution of the marriage would cause substantial material or non-material damage to one of the spouses or to the minor children. \n4. The other spouse or his/her guardian has the right to declare that the marriage is dissolved through the fault of the applicant spouse and to request the court to dissolve the marriage through the fault of the applicant. If the court finds that the application is well founded, the marriage is dissolved by declaring that it was caused by the fault of the spouse who initiated the divorce (Article 3.60 of the present Code). \n\n",
