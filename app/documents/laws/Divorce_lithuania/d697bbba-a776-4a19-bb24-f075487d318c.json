Property which is the separate property of one spouse may be recognised by the court as the community property of the spouses if it is established that, during the marriage, the property has been substantially improved by the spouses' joint funds or by the other spouse's funds or labour (major repairs, reconstruction, alterations, etc.). \n2. If a spouse, in acquiring property for his or her personal needs, also uses funds which are the community property of the spouses, the court may recognise the acquired property as community property if the funds used for the acquisition of that property, which are the community property of the spouses, exceed the funds used, which are the personal property of the spouse. \n\n",
