A spouse may apply to the court for a declaration of legal separation if certain circumstances beyond the control of the other spouse have rendered cohabitation intolerable (impossible) or likely to be substantially prejudicial to the interests of their minor children, or if the spouses are not interested in continuing to live together. \n2. Both spouses may apply jointly to the court for a declaration of legal separation if they have concluded an agreement on the consequences of legal separation in which they have discussed the residence, maintenance and upbringing of the minor children, the division of the matrimonial property and the maintenance of each other. Where the conditions set out in this paragraph are met, and where the spouses do not have minor children in common, the separation shall be certified by a notary by common agreement of the spouses. \n\n",
