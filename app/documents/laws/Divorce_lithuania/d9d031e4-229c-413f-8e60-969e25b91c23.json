A marriage may be dissolved on the application of one of the spouses to the district court of the applicant's place of residence if at least one of the following conditions applies:\n1) the spouses have been separated for more than one year; \n2) one of the spouses has been declared by a court decision to be legally incapacitated or to have limited legal capacity in this area after the marriage; 3) one of the spouses has been declared by a court decision to be unknown; \n4) one of the spouses has been serving a prison sentence for more than one year in connection with an unintentional crime.\n2. In the interests of a spouse who is incapacitated in this area, a petition for divorce may be filed by his or her guardian, by the public prosecutor or by the guardianship and care authority. A spouse with limited capacity in this area may apply for divorce with the consent of the guardian. Where the guardian does not give his consent, the court may, at the request of the person with limited capacity, authorise him to apply for divorce. \n\n",
