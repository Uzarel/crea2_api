    "content": " ACT\n147\nPublic will\nWhen a judge of a municipal court or a court advisor in a municipal court draws up a public will, he does so as part of the official regulation of the court.\nPublic wills for Croatian citizens abroad are drawn up by consular or diplomatic-consular representatives of the Republic of Croatia, as part of their official duties.\nWhen a notary public draws up a public will, he does so in his official seat and for the area where he performs his service. A will drawn up by a notary public in the territory of the Republic of Croatia outside of his official seat and the area where he performs his service is not invalid for that reason alone.\nPersons who are authorized to draw up a public will are at the same time authorized and obliged under the provisions of this Act to perform actions that are within the competence of the court in connection with the preservation, revocation and recording of public and other wills.\n\n",
