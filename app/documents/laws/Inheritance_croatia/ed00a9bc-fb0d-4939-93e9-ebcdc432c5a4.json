Whoever acts in good faith according to the declaration of a person who has declared himself executor of the will with a court certificate, is not responsible for the damage that would result from this for the heirs.\nIf there are several executors of the will, they perform the duties entrusted to them together, unless the testator has determined otherwise.\nIf the executors of the will cannot agree on the performance of their duties, the court, ex officio or at the request of one of them or the heirs, will determine the actions to be taken and authorize one of the executors to undertake them.\n\n",
