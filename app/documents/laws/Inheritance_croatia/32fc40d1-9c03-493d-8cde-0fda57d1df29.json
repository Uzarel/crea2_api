Time of census\nThe list of the decedent's property will be made according to the decision of the probate court when it is not known whether there are any heirs or where they live, when the heirs are persons who, due to minors, mental illness or other circumstances, cannot take care of their rights and interests by themselves, or in other justified cases.\nThe court will also order the list at the request of the testator's heirs, recorder or creditors.\nIf this is required by the special circumstances in which the testator died, and especially if there is a danger that a part of the estate could be alienated or lost, the police officers who arrange in these circumstances, during their administration, if possible, will list the testator's belongings , if necessary, seal the premises where the things are located and submit the list to the registrar responsible for registering the fact of death.\nIn the case referred to in paragraph 3 of this article, the registrar will submit the received list to the probate court conducting probate proceedings.\n\n",
