    "content": " ACT\n189\nAppeal procedure\nThe appeal is submitted to the first-instance court, which, in the event of a timely appeal, can itself, with a new decision, modify the challenged decision, if this does not violate the rights of other persons based on that decision.\nIf the first-instance court does not change its decision, it will submit the appeal to the second-instance court, regardless of whether the appeal was filed within the deadline set by law.\nAs a rule, the second-instance court decides only on appeals that were filed in a timely manner, but it may also take into account an appeal that was filed out of time if it does not violate the rights of other persons based on the contested decision.\nIf an independent appeal is allowed against the decision, the court, if it does not act according to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, will submit a copy of the file with the appeal to the court of second instance. Without waiting for the decision of the second-instance court, the first-instance court will take those actions that it is authorized to take in probate proceedings, regardless of the outcome of the appeal proceedings, if this Law does not stipulate otherwise.\n\n",
