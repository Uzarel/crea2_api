    "content": " ACT\n130\nWaiver of inheritance\nThe heir may renounce the inheritance by a publicly certified statement or a statement made on the court record until the first-instance decision is made.\nThis renunciation is also valid for the descendants of the one who renounced, if the renouncer has not expressly stated that he renounces only on his own behalf.\nIf the renouncer's descendants are minors, this renunciation does not require the approval of the authority responsible for guardianship.\nAn heir who renounces his name is considered as if he had never been an heir.\nIf all the heirs who belong to the closest line of succession renounce the inheritance at the time of the testator's death, the heirs of the next line of succession are invited to inherit. In the event that the other heirs of the first line of succession renounce their inheritance, the spouse remains in the first line of succession.\n\n",
