    "content": " ACT\n219\nThe subject of probate proceedings\nAt the probate hearing, the court will discuss all issues important for making a decision in probate proceedings, especially regarding the right to inheritance, the size of the inheritance and the right to records.\nThe Court of Rights decides, as a rule, after having enabled the interested persons to make the necessary statements. During the probate proceedings, interested persons may make statements without the presence of other interested persons, and it is not necessary in every case to allow these persons to comment on the statements of other interested persons.\nThe court will decide on the rights of persons who did not come to the hearing, but were duly summoned, according to the information at its disposal, taking into account their written statements that reach the decision.\nIf the court suspects that the person who by law claims the right to inheritance is the only or the closest relative of the testator, it may also hear persons whom it considers may have equal or stronger inheritance rights, and it may summon these persons by means of an advertisement in accordance with the provisions of Article 218 of this Act.\n\n",
