    "content": " ACT\n26\nAbility to bequeath\nA will can be made by any person capable of reasoning who has reached the age of 16.\nThe will is void if the testator was not 16 years of age or was not capable of reasoning at the time of making it. If the contrary is not proven, it will be considered that the testator was capable of reasoning at the time of making the will. The testator was not capable of reasoning if at that moment he was not able to understand the meaning of his declaration and its consequences, or he was not able to control his will enough to act in accordance with this knowledge.\nThe loss of the ability to reason that would occur after the will is made does not affect its validity.\n\n",
