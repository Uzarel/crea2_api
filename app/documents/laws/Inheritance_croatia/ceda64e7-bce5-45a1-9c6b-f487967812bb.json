    "content": " ACT\n70\nThe right of a necessary heir\nThe right to a necessary part is an inheritance right, and the part that belongs to an individual necessary heir is called a necessary part.\nDispositions in the event of death that are contrary to one's right to a necessary portion are repugnant.\nThe necessary share of the descendants, adopted children and their descendants and the spouse is one half, and the necessary share of the other necessary heirs is one third of the share that would belong to each of them according to the legal order of inheritance.\nThe testator can specify in his will that the necessary heir receives his share in certain things, rights or in money.\nIn every way, the necessary heir has the right to receive the value of his necessary part in the name of his necessary part when the calculated value of the estate is divided by the size of his necessary inheritance right (value of the necessary part).\n\n",
