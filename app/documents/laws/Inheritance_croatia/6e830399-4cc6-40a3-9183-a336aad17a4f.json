    "content": " ACT\n225\nWho is referred to litigation. Interruption duration\nThe court will refer to litigation or administrative proceedings the party whose right it considers less probable.\nIf the court terminates the proceedings, it will set a deadline that cannot be longer than 30 days, in which the referred party should initiate litigation or administrative proceedings, and inform the probate court about the initiation.\nIf the party complies with the court's decision within a certain period, the suspension of the proceedings will last until the litigation or administrative proceedings are legally concluded.\nIf the party does not comply with the court's decision within a certain period, the proceedings will be interrupted and will be continued and completed regardless of the requests regarding which the party has been sent to litigation, i.e. administrative proceedings. In that case, the party referred to litigation or administrative proceedings may exercise its rights in the procedure to which it was referred.\nIf the probate court acted in accordance with the provision of paragraph 4 of this article, and in the event that it discussed the probate and should have referred the party to litigation or administrative proceedings, the finality of the probate court's decision does not prevent the initiation of litigation or administrative proceedings on the respective request procedure.\n\n",
