    "content": " ACT\n139\nThe extent of the heir's liability for debts\nThe heir is responsible for the decedent's debts.\nAn heir who renounced the inheritance is not liable for the decedent's debts.\nThe heir is responsible for the decedent's debts up to the value of the inherited property, with the fact that the court only pays attention to the amount of the value of the inherited property and the value of the decedent's debts that the heir has already settled, upon the heir's objection.\nWhen there are several heirs, they are jointly and severally liable for the decedent's debts, each up to the value of their inheritance, regardless of whether the inheritance has been divided.\nDebts are divided among the heirs in proportion to their hereditary parts, unless otherwise determined by the will.\nThe subject of execution for the purpose of realizing or securing the claims of the testator's creditors against the municipality or city to which the deceased's estate was transferred can only be things and rights that are an integral part of the estate.\nThe provision of paragraph 6 of this article shall not be applied if the thing or right that is an integral part of the estate is alienated before the submission of the enforcement proposal, that is, the proposal for insurance.\n\n",
