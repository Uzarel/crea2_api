    "content": " ACT\n140\nSeparation of estate\nThe testator's creditors may demand within three months from the opening of the inheritance that the inheritance be separated from the heir's property, if they make it probable that the claim exists and there is a danger that they would not be able to settle their claim without separation.\nIn that case, the heir cannot dispose of the assets and rights of the estate, nor can his creditors be charged from them, until the creditors who demanded separation are paid.\nThe decedent's creditors who demanded this separation can collect their claims only from the assets of the estate.\nThe court may appoint a guardian to a separate estate.\nAt the request of the decedent's creditors, the court may order custody of a separate estate. The costs of entrusting the estate to custody shall be borne by the creditors who requested it.\nIf the creditor who requested the separation does not have a writ of execution or if he has not previously initiated the procedure for the realization of his claim, he is obliged to initiate the procedure for the realization of the claim within the time limit set by the court in the decision on the separation of the estate. If the creditor does not initiate the procedure to which he was directed within the deadline set for him, the court will ex officio annul its decision on the separation of the estate.\nThe court decides on the creditor's request by means of a decision in probate proceedings. An appeal against that decision does not delay its implementation.\n",
