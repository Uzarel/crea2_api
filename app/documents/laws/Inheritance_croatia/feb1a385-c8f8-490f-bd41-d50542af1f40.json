    "content": " ACT\n232\nThe effect of the finality of the decision on inheritance and record\nIt is considered that a legally binding decision on inheritance determines what is part of the estate, who is the decedent's heir, how much of the inheritance belongs to him, whether his inheritance right is limited or encumbered and how, and whether there are any rights to records and which ones. The same applies to a partial decision on inheritance regarding what was determined by them.\nWhat has been determined by a valid inheritance decision can only be disputed by the person who, according to the provisions of this Act, is not bound by the finality of the inheritance decision. He can refute this only through a lawsuit with the persons in whose favor the determination is made, the veracity of which he disputes.\nPersons who claim that they are entitled to a right regarding what has been determined to be part of the inheritance are not bound by a valid decision on inheritance, if they did not participate in the inheritance hearing as parties, nor were they properly invited to it in person.\nPersons who claim that due to the decedent's death they have inherited the right on the basis of a will or law, or that they have acquired the right to a record, are not bound by a valid decision on inheritance, if they did not participate as parties in the probate proceedings, nor did they participate in it were properly personally invited.\nPersons who, as parties, participated in the probate hearing or were properly invited to it in person, but are not bound by the final decision on inheritance, are bound:\n- regarding the rights that would arise for them from a subsequently found will,\n- regarding rights whose determination depended on how a disputed issue will be resolved in a lawsuit or administrative procedure to which the probate court referred them, or should have referred them, if that issue was not resolved before the decision on inheritance became final,\n- if the conditions under which they could require a repetition of the procedure in civil proceedings are met.\n\n",
