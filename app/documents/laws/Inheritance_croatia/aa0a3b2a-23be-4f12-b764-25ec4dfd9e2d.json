    "content": " ACT\n134\nWaiver of unopened inheritance\nRenunciation of inheritance that is not open has no legal effect.\nExceptionally, a descendant who can dispose of his rights independently can waive the inheritance that would have accrued to him after the death of the ancestor by contract with the ancestor. The same applies to the case when a spouse renounces the inheritance that would have belonged to him as a spouse after the death of his spouse.\nThe agreement on renunciation of inheritance is valid only if it is drawn up in writing and:\n- certified by a judge of the competent court, or\n- drawn up in the form of a notarial deed, or\n- confirmed ( solemnized ) by a notary public.\nThe authorized persons referred to in paragraph 3 of this article are obliged to read the contract and warn the contracting parties about the consequences of the contract.\nThis renunciation is also valid for the descendants of the one who renounced, unless otherwise specified in the renunciation contract or subsequent agreement.\n\n",
