A person who is a witness of identity, and/or a witness to a will, can also be an interpreter's witness, if he has the necessary knowledge.\nIf the testator is mute, deaf or deaf-blind , so that this is an obstacle to making a will, a sworn interpreter and two witnesses who can communicate with the testator will be called, to which the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article will be applied accordingly. .\nA will does not have the valid form of a public will if, in the case referred to in paragraph 1 or 3 of this article, the appropriate interpreter and the interpreter's witnesses were not present at the time of making the will, or if the witnesses immediately declare that the interpreter did not convey the statement of the testator's will faithfully enough, or that his the testator did not successfully communicate with the authorized person through mediation.\nIn cases where the testator cannot use the official language, or is not obliged to do so, as well as when he is mute, deaf or deaf-blind so that it interferes with the making of the will, an interpreter will be called even if the authorized person knows the language used by the testator, that is, if he is able to come to an agreement with the testator.\nIn the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 of this article, both the interpreter and the witnesses sign the record of the drafting of the will.\nThe identity of the interpreter and the witness of the interpreter is established as well as the identity of the testamentary witnesses.\n\n",
